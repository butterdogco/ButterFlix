WEBVTT

00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:09.080
Ok, hold on, don't shoot.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.297
You see where you're going?

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:13.560
Ok.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:15.635
Now, let's worry about
how you get there.

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:18.190
Gotta move your foot here.

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:19.757
Point your toe this way.

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:22.072
Your hips here.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:23.164
Ok?

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.069
Can you see?

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:26.603
Yeah.
Are you sure?

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:28.574
How about now?
Can you see now?

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:29.746
No.
How about now?

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:32.736
Alright.

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:34.524
Ready?

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:35.514
Three fingers.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:37.487
Nice!

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.588
Nice throw, kiddo.

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:41.748
Here you go.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.765
Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard?

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:45.523
Or both?

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:48.259
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:49.406
Probably your brothers.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.739
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:52.642
Got it!

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.110
Nate, mayo or mustard?

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:56.702
How about ketchup?

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.144
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.391
Mind your elbow.

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:04.640
Good job, hawk-eye.

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:05.658
Go get your arrow.

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.269
Hey, guys!

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:11.707
Enough practice.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:12.656
Soup's on!

00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:13.930
Alright.

00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:15.703
We're coming.
We're hungry.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.687
Lila, let's go.

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:21.926
Lila?

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:26.188
Honey?

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.218
Hey, babe?

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:41.575
Babe?

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:44.904
Babe?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.932
Boys!

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:51.208
Boys!

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:54.297
Laura!

00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:39.807
You don't need to do that.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.939
Because, you're just
holding the position.

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:45.085
Only that.

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:46.737
That was close.

00:02:48.273 --> 00:02:49.214
That's a goal.

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:50.220
We are now one apiece.

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.638
I would like to try again.

00:02:53.838 --> 00:02:56.304
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:57.236
It's fun.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.139
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.511
And you've won.

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:04.444
Congratulations.

00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:05.703
Fair game.

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:08.297
Good sport.

00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:10.752
You have fun?

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:14.033
It was fun.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.494
This thing on?

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.072
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.600
If you find this recording...

00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:48.599
don't post it...

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.808
on social media.
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.503
I don't know if you're ever
gonna see these.

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:56.808
I don't even know if you're still...

00:03:57.934 --> 00:03:59.282
Oh God, I hope so.

00:04:00.475 --> 00:04:02.452
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:04.740
<i>No, 22.</i>

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.424
<i>You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror,</i>

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:10.860
<i>of staring into the literal void of space,</i>

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.652
<i>I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.</i>

00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:14.520
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.537
<i>thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:18.336
<i>You'd love her.</i>

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:19.796
<i>Very practical.</i>

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:22.427
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:29.080
<i>So, the fuel cells were cracked</i>

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:31.882
<i>during battle and we figured out
a way to reverse the ion charge...</i>

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:34.374
<i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i>

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:39.769
<i>But it's now dead in the water.</i>

00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:43.175
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:47.011
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:50.093
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.906
<i>And Pep, I...</i>

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.560
<i>I know I said no more surprises but,</i>

00:04:57.562 --> 00:05:00.362
<i>I got to say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.</i>

00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:02.207
<i>But it looks like...</i>

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:04.770
<i>Well, you know what it looks like.</i>

00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:07.718
Don't feel bad about this.

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.407
I mean actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:14.392
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:22.169
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:23.399
Go rest my eyes.

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:28.184
Please know...

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.780
when I drift off,
it'll be like every night lately.

00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:35.976
I'm fine. Totally fine.

00:05:37.012 --> 00:05:38.446
I dream about you.

00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:41.573
Because it's always you.

00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:05.652
Couldn't stop him.

00:09:05.665 --> 00:09:06.363
Neither could I.

00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:07.821
Hang on.

00:09:10.293 --> 00:09:11.555
I lost the kid.

00:09:14.582 --> 00:09:15.799
Tony, we lost.

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:19.285
Is...

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:21.960
Good.
Oh my God!

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:24.311
Oh my God!

00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:30.741
It's ok.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.907
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.746
World governments are in pieces.

00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:46.813
The parts that are still working...

00:09:47.214 --> 00:09:50.341
are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:55.388
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.656
Thanos wiped out...

00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:01.579
50% of all living creatures.

00:10:06.248 --> 00:10:07.320
Where is he now? Where?

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:09.211
We don't know.

00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:12.720
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:16.882
What's wrong with him?

00:10:17.858 --> 00:10:18.872
He's pissed.

00:10:20.345 --> 00:10:21.478
He thinks he failed.

00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:23.995
Which of course he did,

00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:26.101
but there is a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:29.070
Honestly, until this exact second
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:29.996
Maybe I am.

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:32.164
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:33.654
Deep space scans...

00:10:34.587 --> 00:10:36.025
and satellites, and we got nothing.

00:10:38.353 --> 00:10:39.536
Tony, you fought him.

00:10:39.654 --> 00:10:40.637
Who told you that?

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:41.993
I didn't fight him.

00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.067
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:46.369
while the Bleecker Street
magician gave away the store.

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:47.883
That's what happened.
There was no fight,

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:49.097
because he's not beatable.
Ok.

00:10:49.173 --> 00:10:52.038
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

00:10:54.607 --> 00:10:56.178
I saw this coming a few years back.

00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:57.862
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

00:10:58.865 --> 00:10:59.853
Thought I was dreaming.

00:11:00.064 --> 00:11:02.322
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.
And I needed you.

00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:05.837
As in past tense, that trumps,

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:07.558
what you need, it's too late buddy.

00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:08.849
Sorry.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.567
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.336
And I believe I rememeber telling.

00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:16.865
Tony, Tony, Tony...
Oh yes.

00:11:16.927 --> 00:11:18.387
Why that otherwise,

00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:20.149
that what we needed,

00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:23.231
was a suit of armor around
the world. Remember that?

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:25.713
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms,

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:27.641
or not. That's what we needed.

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:30.198
Well that didn't work out, did it?
I said we'd lose.

00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:32.945
You said, We'll do that together, too.

00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:34.476
Well guess what, Cap?

00:11:34.613 --> 00:11:35.780
We lost.

00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:37.568
You weren't there.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.290
But that's what we do, right?

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:41.733
Our best work after the fact?

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.208
We're the Avengers?

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.460
We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

00:11:45.462 --> 00:11:46.897
Ok. You made your point.
Right?

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:47.837
Just sit down, ok?
Ok.

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:48.834
No, no. Here's my...
Tony, sit.

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:50.350
She's great by the way.
Sit down!

00:11:50.368 --> 00:11:52.053
We need you.
You're new blood.

00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:53.215
Bunch of tired old mills...

00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:56.716
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

00:11:57.013 --> 00:11:59.531
no clues, no strategies, no options.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.055
Zero. Zip. Nada.

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.548
No trust, you liar...

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.108
You take this.

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:10.861
You find him and you put that on.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:12.688
You hide.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:15.921
Tony!
I'm fine.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:17.443
I...

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:26.221
Bruce gave him a sedative.

00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:28.300
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:30.428
You guys take care of him.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.275
And I'll bring an Bezurian
elixir when I come back.

00:12:32.922 --> 00:12:35.398
Where are you going?
To kill Thanos.

00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:39.382
Hey.

00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:42.125
You know we usually work
as a team here and...

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:44.124
between you and I
we're also a little fragile.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.613
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight too.

00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:50.296
You even know where he is?
I know people who might.

00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:51.392
Don't bother.

00:12:52.787 --> 00:12:54.342
I can tell you where Thanos is.

00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:59.928
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:02.625
Then when he worked,
he talked about...

00:13:03.007 --> 00:13:04.237
his great plan.

00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:07.316
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.115
I'd ask,

00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:12.154
where would we go once
his plan was complete?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.977
His answer was always the same.

00:13:19.506 --> 00:13:20.631
To The Garden.

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:22.187
That's cute.

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:23.921
Thanos has a retirement plan.

00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:24.980
So where is he?

00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:27.692
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

00:13:27.738 --> 00:13:32.134
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:33.792
No one's ever seen anything like it...

00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:36.159
until two days ago.

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:39.002
On this planet.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:41.389
Thanos is there.

00:13:43.264 --> 00:13:44.795
He used the stones again.

00:13:45.037 --> 00:13:46.305
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:49.157
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

00:13:49.186 --> 00:13:50.781
Look, he still got the stones, so...

00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:51.803
So let's get him.

00:13:52.424 --> 00:13:53.987
We use them to bring everyone back.

00:13:53.989 --> 00:13:54.966
Just like that?

00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.796
Yeah. Just like that.

00:13:57.026 --> 00:14:00.371
Even if there is a small chance
that we can undo this...

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.780
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

00:14:03.018 --> 00:14:07.260
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

00:14:07.262 --> 00:14:09.020
Because before, you didn't have me.

00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:14.009
Hey new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.896
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.969
There are a lot of other planets
in the universe.

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:21.644
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:42.864
I like this one.

00:14:48.598 --> 00:14:50.488
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:13.892
Ok.

00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:16.625
Who here hasn't been to space?

00:15:18.815 --> 00:15:20.634
You better not throw up on my ship.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.491
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:39.733
I'll head down for recon.

00:15:58.442 --> 00:15:59.864
This is gonna work Steve.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.400
I know it will.

00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:07.303
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.498
No satellites,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.511
no ships,

00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:13.607
no armies, no ground defenses
of any kind.

00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:16.723
It's just him.

00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:19.159
Then that's enough.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:49.856
Oh no.

00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:01.024
Where are they?

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:03.357
Answer the question.

00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:07.895
The universe required correction.

00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:09.730
After that,

00:18:09.732 --> 00:18:11.864
the stones served no purpose,

00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:13.855
beyond temptation.

00:18:13.857 --> 00:18:15.216
You murdered trillions!

00:18:16.932 --> 00:18:18.339
You should be grateful.

00:18:22.607 --> 00:18:23.930
Where are the stones?

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:25.563
Gone.

00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.713
Reduced to atoms.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.584
You used them two days ago.

00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:32.711
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:35.462
It nearly killed me.

00:18:36.787 --> 00:18:38.314
But the work is done.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.461
It always will be.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.269
I am inevitable.

00:18:48.673 --> 00:18:51.187
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

00:18:51.249 --> 00:18:52.698
My father is many things.

00:18:53.408 --> 00:18:54.969
A liar is not one of them.

00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:00.692
Thank you, Daughter.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.010
Perhaps I treated you too harshly...

00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:13.075
What...

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:15.106
What did you do?

00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:18.721
I went for the head.

00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:31.145
So I...

00:20:33.263 --> 00:20:34.680
Went on a date the other day.

00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:38.341
It's the first time in five years,
you know?

00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:39.480
Sit there, dinner...

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:42.689
I didn't know what to talk about.

00:20:44.803 --> 00:20:46.076
What did you talk about?

00:20:46.136 --> 00:20:47.786
Same old crap, you know?

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.371
How things have changed and...

00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:51.939
My job, his job...

00:20:52.714 --> 00:20:54.326
How much we miss the Mets.

00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.934
Then things get quiet..

00:21:00.878 --> 00:21:04.190
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:06.030
What about you?

00:21:07.307 --> 00:21:10.299
I cried just before dessert.

00:21:14.203 --> 00:21:16.786
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

00:21:16.982 --> 00:21:17.816
That's great.

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.507
You did the hardest part.

00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:21.789
You took the jump, you didn't know
where you were gonna come down.

00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:24.920
And that's it.
That's those little...

00:21:25.193 --> 00:21:27.049
brave baby steps you got to take.

00:21:27.684 --> 00:21:30.874
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

00:21:32.942 --> 00:21:36.153
I went in the ice in '45 right after
I met the love of my life.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.601
Woke up 70 years later.

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.071
You got to move on.

00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:48.680
Got to move on.

00:21:54.044 --> 00:21:55.441
The world is in our hands.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.714
It's left to us guys.

00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:00.503
And we got to do something with it.

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:02.897
Otherwise...

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:05.999
Thanos should have killed all of us.

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:09.780
What the hell?

00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:23.043
Hope?

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.618
Kid!

00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.014
Hey, kid!

00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:04.770
What the hell happened here?

00:24:37.132 --> 00:24:38.210
My God...

00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:42.929
No. Please.

00:24:43.423 --> 00:24:44.621
Please, please.

00:24:45.035 --> 00:24:46.160
No, no, no.

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:47.236
No.

00:24:48.837 --> 00:24:49.362
No.

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:53.759
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:54.919
No, Cassie, no.

00:24:55.936 --> 00:24:56.369
No.

00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:58.603
No, no.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.210
Please, please, please, please, please.

00:25:02.212 --> 00:25:03.212
Please. No, Cassie.

00:25:10.888 --> 00:25:11.599
What?

00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:42.820
Cassie?

00:25:44.462 --> 00:25:45.050
Dad?

00:26:11.902 --> 00:26:13.138
You're so big!

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:32.051
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

00:26:32.053 --> 00:26:33.977
It was an infectious garbage scowl.

00:26:34.082 --> 00:26:35.559
So, thanks for the hot tip.

00:26:35.756 --> 00:26:36.859
Well, you were closer.

00:26:37.026 --> 00:26:38.588
Yeah.
And now we smell like garbage.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.401
You get a reading on those tremors?

00:26:40.403 --> 00:26:42.895
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

00:26:43.014 --> 00:26:45.101
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

00:26:45.263 --> 00:26:48.392
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

00:26:48.862 --> 00:26:51.370
We handle it by not handling it.

00:26:52.474 --> 00:26:54.872
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:55.944
Not likely.

00:26:55.946 --> 00:26:57.951
What, you gonna get another haircut?

00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:59.250
Listen, fur-face.

00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:01.359
I'm covering a lot of territory.

00:27:01.636 --> 00:27:03.192
The things that are happening on Earth

00:27:03.194 --> 00:27:04.578
are happening everywhere,

00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:06.403
on thousands of planets.

00:27:06.997 --> 00:27:08.610
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.624
So you might not see
me for a long time.

00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:13.414
Alright.

00:27:13.908 --> 00:27:14.543
Well...

00:27:15.253 --> 00:27:16.834
This channel is always active.

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:18.924
So, anything goes sideways...

00:27:19.628 --> 00:27:21.533
Anyone's making trouble
where they should not...

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.470
Comes through me.

00:27:23.856 --> 00:27:24.953
Ok.
Ok.

00:27:25.213 --> 00:27:25.969
Alright.

00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:28.356
Good luck.

00:27:37.102 --> 00:27:38.040
Where are you?

00:27:38.362 --> 00:27:39.112
Mexico.

00:27:39.371 --> 00:27:41.723
The federales found a room
full of bodies.

00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:43.084
Looks like a...

00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:46.154
bunch of cartel guys. Never even
had the chance to get their guns off.

00:27:46.224 --> 00:27:47.749
It's probably a rival gang.

00:27:48.388 --> 00:27:49.471
Except it isn't.

00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:50.997
It's definitely Barton.

00:27:52.139 --> 00:27:53.404
What he's done here,

00:27:53.982 --> 00:27:56.507
what he's been doing
for the last few years,

00:27:58.098 --> 00:27:59.651
I mean, the scene that he left...

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.653
I got to tell you, there is a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

00:28:09.867 --> 00:28:11.563
Will you find out where he's going next?

00:28:16.164 --> 00:28:16.893
Nat...

00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:19.489
Please.

00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:23.220
Ok.

00:28:32.373 --> 00:28:34.227
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner but...

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:36.225
you seem pretty miserable already.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.599
You here to do your laundry?

00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:42.988
And to see a friend.

00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:45.902
Clearly, your friend is fine.

00:28:49.973 --> 00:28:52.498
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.491
In the Hudson?

00:28:53.493 --> 00:28:55.465
There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

00:28:55.613 --> 00:28:57.700
You know, if you're about to tell me...

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.527
to look on the bright side...

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.969
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

00:29:07.837 --> 00:29:08.729
Sorry.

00:29:09.167 --> 00:29:10.259
Force of habit.

00:29:24.525 --> 00:29:27.468
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and...

00:29:28.212 --> 00:29:29.051
grow.

00:29:30.883 --> 00:29:31.797
Some do.

00:29:35.586 --> 00:29:36.757
But not us.

00:29:38.003 --> 00:29:39.472
If I move on, who does this?

00:29:40.215 --> 00:29:41.905
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.052
I used to have nothing.

00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:51.493
And then I got this.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.272
This job.

00:29:58.367 --> 00:29:59.522
This family.

00:30:03.696 --> 00:30:04.948
And I was...

00:30:05.832 --> 00:30:07.444
I was better because of it.

00:30:14.054 --> 00:30:15.196
And even though...

00:30:16.588 --> 00:30:17.669
they're gone...

00:30:21.378 --> 00:30:23.528
Now, I'm still trying to be better.

00:30:27.053 --> 00:30:28.738
I think we both need to get a life.

00:30:31.998 --> 00:30:32.977
You first.

00:30:38.852 --> 00:30:39.881
<i>Hi. Hi!</i>

00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:41.145
<i>Is anyone home?</i>

00:30:41.547 --> 00:30:42.705
<i>This is Scott Lang.</i>

00:30:43.352 --> 00:30:45.846
<i>We met a few years ago,
at the airport?</i>

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:47.356
<i>In Germany?</i>

00:30:47.782 --> 00:30:50.680
<i>I was the guy that got really big
and I had my mask on.</i>

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.082
<i>You would not recognize me.</i>
Is this an old message?

00:30:52.216 --> 00:30:53.049
<i>Ant-Man?</i>

00:30:53.215 --> 00:30:55.186
<i>Ant-Man, I know you know.
I know you know that.</i>

00:30:55.261 --> 00:30:56.284
It's the front gate.

00:30:56.395 --> 00:30:57.918
<i>I need to talk to you guys.</i>

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:04.950
Scott.

00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:08.004
Are you ok?
Yeah.

00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:12.519
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

00:31:13.051 --> 00:31:14.426
Only in mid-conversation.

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:16.566
Alright. So...

00:31:17.603 --> 00:31:18.686
Five years ago,

00:31:18.828 --> 00:31:20.134
Right, right before...

00:31:21.025 --> 00:31:21.912
Thanos,

00:31:22.444 --> 00:31:24.247
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:27.553
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:28.645
To get in there, you have to be

00:31:28.647 --> 00:31:30.975
incredibly small.
Hope, she's my...

00:31:33.147 --> 00:31:34.536
She was... she was my...

00:31:36.157 --> 00:31:38.007
She. She was supposed
to pull me out.

00:31:38.009 --> 00:31:39.944
And then, Thanos happened and

00:31:39.968 --> 00:31:41.479
I got stuck in there.

00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:43.770
Sorry.
That must've been a long 5 years.

00:31:43.778 --> 00:31:44.879
Yeah, but that's just it.

00:31:45.464 --> 00:31:46.341
It wasn't.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.077
For me it was five hours.

00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:50.856
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

00:31:50.879 --> 00:31:53.796
Everything is unpredictable.
Is that anybody's sandwich?

00:31:53.985 --> 00:31:55.003
I'm starving.

00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:56.366
Scott.

00:31:56.917 --> 00:31:57.953
What are you talking about?

00:31:59.247 --> 00:31:59.969
So...

00:32:01.371 --> 00:32:02.663
What I'm saying is...

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.987
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.807
The only problem is right now,

00:32:08.243 --> 00:32:09.683
we don't have a way to navigate it.

00:32:10.097 --> 00:32:11.137
But what if we did?

00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:12.753
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:14.490
What if we could somehow control...

00:32:14.492 --> 00:32:16.190
the chaos and we could navigate it?

00:32:16.192 --> 00:32:18.709
What if there was a way
that we can enter

00:32:18.842 --> 00:32:20.682
the quantum realm
at a certain point in time,

00:32:20.684 --> 00:32:22.301
but then exit the quantum realm

00:32:22.303 --> 00:32:23.669
at another point in time?

00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:24.619
Like...

00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:26.955
Like before Thanos.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.381
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

00:32:29.879 --> 00:32:32.847
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:34.121
It's more like a...

00:32:35.962 --> 00:32:37.684
Yeah, a time machine.

00:32:37.686 --> 00:32:39.470
I know it's crazy. It's crazy.

00:32:39.664 --> 00:32:40.245
But I...

00:32:40.471 --> 00:32:41.738
But I can't stop thinking about it.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.949
There's got to be...

00:32:44.033 --> 00:32:45.050
Some wa...

00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:46.943
It's crazy.
Scott.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:48.514
I get e-mails from a raccoon.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.692
So, nothing sounds crazy anymore.

00:32:51.755 --> 00:32:53.370
So who do we talk to about this?

00:33:11.846 --> 00:33:12.653
Chow-time!

00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:16.315
Morgoona.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.509
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

00:33:23.326 --> 00:33:25.761
Define lunch or be disintegrated.
Ok.

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:28.323
You should not be wearing that, ok?

00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:31.025
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:36.793
There you go.
Are you thinking about lunch?

00:33:37.585 --> 00:33:38.984
I can give you a handful of crickets.

00:33:38.986 --> 00:33:40.190
On a bed of lettuce.
No.

00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:41.219
That's what you want.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.663
How did you find this?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.808
Garage.

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:45.577
Really?

00:33:45.796 --> 00:33:47.207
Were you looking for it?

00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:47.948
No.

00:33:48.703 --> 00:33:49.899
I found it, though.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.219
You like going to the garage?

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.835
So does Daddy.

00:33:54.838 --> 00:33:55.834
It's fine actually.

00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:57.423
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:01.362
So, I'm gonna...

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.644
No. We know what it sounds like.

00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:23.862
Tony, after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible?

00:34:23.864 --> 00:34:26.148
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:27.971
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

00:34:27.973 --> 00:34:28.887
Can we agree on that?

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:30.132
Thank you.

00:34:30.426 --> 00:34:31.857
In layman's terms, it means,

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:32.986
you're not coming home.

00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:34.240
I did.
No.

00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:35.721
You accidentally survived.

00:34:36.227 --> 00:34:38.047
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

00:34:38.702 --> 00:34:40.002
And now you wanna pull a...

00:34:40.801 --> 00:34:41.832
What do you call it?

00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:45.123
A time heist?

00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:46.531
Yeah, a time heist.

00:34:46.747 --> 00:34:47.543
Of course.

00:34:47.545 --> 00:34:48.578
Why didn't we think of this before?

00:34:49.584 --> 00:34:51.514
Because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

00:34:51.608 --> 00:34:53.017
The stones are in the past.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.131
We could go back, we could get them.

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:57.295
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

00:34:57.437 --> 00:34:59.481
Or screw it up worse
than he already has, right?

00:34:59.624 --> 00:35:00.711
I don't believe we would.

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:03.776
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.300
However, high hopes won't help...

00:35:06.474 --> 00:35:08.434
if there is no logical, tangible way

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:10.588
for me to safely execute said...

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:12.000
time heist.

00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.074
I believe the most likely outcome,

00:35:14.076 --> 00:35:15.310
will be our collective demise.

00:35:15.312 --> 00:35:17.694
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:20.357
It means no talking to our past...

00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:22.401
selves no betting on sporting events.

00:35:22.403 --> 00:35:24.466
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.793
Are you seriously telling me,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.599
that your plan to save the universe...

00:35:28.653 --> 00:35:30.322
is based on, Back to the Future?

00:35:31.714 --> 00:35:32.289
Is it?

00:35:32.687 --> 00:35:33.289
No.

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:35.649
Good. You had me worried there.
Because that would be horseshit.

00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:37.967
That's not how quantum physics works.

00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:38.954
Tony.

00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:42.842
We have to take a stand.

00:35:43.566 --> 00:35:44.439
We did stand.

00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:45.892
And yet, here we are.

00:35:47.793 --> 00:35:49.331
I know you got a lot on the line.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.527
You got a wife, a daughter.

00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:54.374
But I lost someone very important to me.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.309
A lotta people did.

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:57.377
And now,

00:35:57.379 --> 00:35:59.826
now we have a chance
to bring her back...

00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:01.085
to bring everyone back,

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.694
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

00:36:02.696 --> 00:36:04.490
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

00:36:06.395 --> 00:36:07.143
I can't.

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:11.634
Mommy told me to come
and save you.

00:36:12.027 --> 00:36:12.944
Good job.

00:36:13.453 --> 00:36:14.439
I'm saved.

00:36:15.424 --> 00:36:17.327
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

00:36:17.444 --> 00:36:18.434
Anything else.

00:36:18.761 --> 00:36:20.468
I'm honestly happy to see you guys,
I just...

00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:21.630
look, the table's set for six.

00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:23.141
Tony. I get it.

00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:25.844
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:28.354
But this is a second chance.

00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:30.681
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

00:36:31.649 --> 00:36:33.039
Can't roll the dice on it.

00:36:35.277 --> 00:36:37.277
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:41.544
Well, he's scared.

00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:43.125
He's not wrong.

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:45.532
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

00:36:45.594 --> 00:36:46.879
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.223
No, I wanna do it right.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.719
We're gonna need a really big brain.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:56.838
Bigger than his?

00:36:57.758 --> 00:36:59.310
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:00.084
Try some of that.

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:01.553
Have some eggs.

00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:03.389
I'm so confused.

00:37:03.472 --> 00:37:04.753
These are confusing times.

00:37:05.082 --> 00:37:06.071
Right, no, no, no, no.

00:37:06.073 --> 00:37:07.227
No that's not what I meant.

00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.770
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:11.888
I know, it's crazy.

00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:13.738
I'm wearing shirts now.

00:37:13.816 --> 00:37:16.652
Yeah. What? How? Why?

00:37:16.978 --> 00:37:19.010
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

00:37:19.962 --> 00:37:21.444
Except it was worse for me...

00:37:21.607 --> 00:37:22.817
because I lost twice.

00:37:23.062 --> 00:37:24.855
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:27.246
and then, we all lost.

00:37:27.248 --> 00:37:28.499
No one blamed you, Bruce.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:29.738
I did.

00:37:31.676 --> 00:37:34.377
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease,

00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:35.633
something to get rid of.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.157
But then I start looking
at him as the cure.

00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.845
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:44.459
I put the brains and the brawn together...

00:37:44.771 --> 00:37:46.181
and now, look at me.

00:37:47.086 --> 00:37:48.664
Best of both worlds.

00:37:49.144 --> 00:37:50.769
Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
Yes.

00:37:50.811 --> 00:37:52.146
Can we. Can we get a photo?

00:37:52.383 --> 00:37:54.385
100%, little person.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.799
Come on, step on up.

00:37:55.887 --> 00:37:56.794
Do you mind?

00:37:57.484 --> 00:37:58.486
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.

00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:00.275
Say green.

00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:03.323
Green.
Green.

00:38:03.407 --> 00:38:04.408
Did you get that?

00:38:04.575 --> 00:38:05.672
That's a good one.

00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:07.728
Did you want to grab one with me?

00:38:08.165 --> 00:38:09.050
I'm Ant-Man.

00:38:12.424 --> 00:38:13.366
They're Hulk fans.
Wait.

00:38:13.368 --> 00:38:14.313
They don't know Ant-Man.
No. No. I...

00:38:14.315 --> 00:38:15.548
Nobody does. Nobody does.
Don't feel bad.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.208
No. He wants,

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.308
you to take a picture with him.
I don't want a picture.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.266
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

00:38:20.268 --> 00:38:21.089
I get it.
Come on.

00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:22.512
I don't want it, either.
The kids... But you...

00:38:22.514 --> 00:38:23.949
I don't want a picture with them.
But...

00:38:24.116 --> 00:38:25.253
He's gonna feel bad.
Sorry.

00:38:25.255 --> 00:38:26.762
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

00:38:26.764 --> 00:38:27.932
No I don't want to do it.
We can do it.

00:38:27.934 --> 00:38:28.992
No, you feel bad.

00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:30.036
Take the goddamn phone.

00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:30.967
Ok.

00:38:31.872 --> 00:38:32.873
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

00:38:32.895 --> 00:38:34.576
No, it was great, kids.
Thank you very much.

00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:36.140
Hulk out!

00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:37.374
Bruce.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.947
Dab.

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.986
Bruce.
Listen to your mom.

00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:42.362
She knows better.

00:38:42.427 --> 00:38:43.527
About what we were saying.

00:38:44.364 --> 00:38:45.074
Right.

00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:49.647
The whole time travel do-over?

00:38:51.402 --> 00:38:54.286
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

00:38:55.709 --> 00:38:56.960
Well, you pulled this off.

00:38:58.003 --> 00:39:00.831
I remember a time when
that seemed pretty impossible, too.

00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:36.556
I've got a mild inspiration.

00:39:36.622 --> 00:39:37.877
I'd like to see if it checks out.

00:39:38.153 --> 00:39:38.867
So,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.680
I'd like to run one last SIM
before we pack it in for the night.

00:39:41.927 --> 00:39:44.930
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

00:39:45.014 --> 00:39:46.390
inverted, please.

00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:47.636
<i>Processing.</i>

00:39:51.098 --> 00:39:52.667
Right, give me the eigenvalue,

00:39:52.669 --> 00:39:55.511
of that particle
factoring in spectral decomp.

00:39:55.936 --> 00:39:57.896
That'll take a second.
<i>Just a moment.</i>

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.738
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.388
<i>Model rendered.</i>

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:17.461
Shit!

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.844
Shit!

00:40:23.297 --> 00:40:25.007
What are you doing up, little miss?

00:40:25.173 --> 00:40:25.812
Shit.

00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:27.048
Nope. We don't say that.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.260
Only Mommy says that word.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.886
She coined it. It belongs to her.

00:40:30.012 --> 00:40:31.013
Why are you up?

00:40:31.138 --> 00:40:33.017
Because I've got some important shit
going on here!

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:33.849
Why do you think?

00:40:33.922 --> 00:40:35.342
No I got, I got something on my mind.

00:40:35.521 --> 00:40:36.977
I got. I got something on my mind.

00:40:37.144 --> 00:40:38.687
Was it juice pops?

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.153
Sure was.

00:40:42.779 --> 00:40:44.610
That's extortion. That's a word.

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:45.726
What kind you want?

00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:47.155
Great minds think alike.

00:40:47.232 --> 00:40:48.563
Juice pops exactly...

00:40:48.728 --> 00:40:49.530
was on...

00:40:51.196 --> 00:40:52.307
my mind.

00:40:53.553 --> 00:40:54.940
You done? Yeah?

00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:56.469
Now you are.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.189
Here. Wipe.

00:41:01.168 --> 00:41:01.877
Good.

00:41:02.274 --> 00:41:04.010
That face goes there.

00:41:04.012 --> 00:41:05.069
Tell me a story.

00:41:05.422 --> 00:41:06.118
A story.

00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:08.211
Once upon a time,

00:41:08.213 --> 00:41:09.302
Maguna went to bed. The end.

00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:11.125
That is a horrible story.

00:41:11.127 --> 00:41:12.879
Come on, that's your favorite story.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.670
Love you tons.

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.442
I love you 3,000.

00:41:28.278 --> 00:41:31.156
3,000. That's crazy.

00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:34.159
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:36.405
Night night.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.261
Not that it's a competition...

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.499
but she loves me 3,000.

00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:41.750
Does she, now?

00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:43.036
You were somewhere in the low...

00:41:43.573 --> 00:41:45.157
6 to 900 range.

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:52.003
Whatcha reading?

00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:54.712
Just a book on composting.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.925
What's new with composting?

00:41:58.308 --> 00:42:00.073
Interesting science...
I figured it out.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.281
By the way.

00:42:03.313 --> 00:42:04.481
And, you know,

00:42:04.483 --> 00:42:06.171
just so we're talking
about the same thing.

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:07.719
Time travel.

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:09.968
What?

00:42:16.964 --> 00:42:17.909
That's...

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:20.356
amazing, and...

00:42:21.623 --> 00:42:22.537
terrifying.

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:23.634
That's right.

00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:32.949
We got really lucky.

00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:34.273
Yeah.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.526
I know.

00:42:36.013 --> 00:42:37.139
A lot of people didn't.

00:42:37.226 --> 00:42:38.853
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

00:42:40.684 --> 00:42:42.019
Sorta seems like you can.

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:43.263
Not if I stop.

00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:47.449
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

00:42:48.548 --> 00:42:49.282
Tony...

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.793
trying to get you to stop...

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.572
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life.

00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:00.662
Something tells me I should put it...

00:43:01.842 --> 00:43:04.198
in a lockbox and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

00:43:05.795 --> 00:43:06.793
and go to bed.

00:43:13.182 --> 00:43:15.226
But would you be able to rest?

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.714
Ok. Here we go.
Time travel test number one.

00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:25.713
Scott, fire up the...

00:43:26.772 --> 00:43:27.939
van thing.

00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:31.276
Breakers are set.

00:43:31.443 --> 00:43:33.278
Emergency generators are on standby.

00:43:33.459 --> 00:43:36.074
Good, because if we blow the grid,
I don't want to lose...

00:43:36.402 --> 00:43:38.254
Tiny here in the 1950s.

00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:39.316
Excuse me?

00:43:39.487 --> 00:43:40.964
He's kidding.

00:43:41.466 --> 00:43:42.904
You can't say things like that.

00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:45.104
Just... It was a bad joke.

00:43:47.346 --> 00:43:48.390
You were kidding, right?

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:51.479
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:53.733
Either it's all a joke or none of it is.

00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:55.062
We're good!

00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:57.302
Get your helmet on.

00:43:57.928 --> 00:43:59.805
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week,

00:43:59.807 --> 00:44:01.434
let you walk around for an hour,

00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:02.938
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

00:44:03.422 --> 00:44:04.423
Make sense?

00:44:04.935 --> 00:44:06.186
Perfectly not confusing.

00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:07.319
Good luck, Scott.

00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:08.594
You got this.

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:10.715
You're right.

00:44:11.287 --> 00:44:12.745
I do, Captain America.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.404
On a count of three...

00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:17.086
Three.

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:18.660
Two.

00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:20.343
One.

00:44:24.718 --> 00:44:25.372
Guys?

00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:26.391
This.

00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:27.937
This doesn't feel right.

00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:29.666
What is this? What's going on?
Who is that?

00:44:29.788 --> 00:44:30.697
Hold on.
Is that Scott?

00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:31.705
Yes, it's Scott.

00:44:35.278 --> 00:44:37.053
What's going on, Bruce?
My back!

00:44:37.169 --> 00:44:38.243
What is this?
Hold on a second.

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.383
Could I get a little space here?

00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:40.598
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.784
I'm working on it.

00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:49.715
It's a baby.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.523
It's Scott.
As a baby.

00:44:51.567 --> 00:44:53.150
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:54.913
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.321
Oh my God.

00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:57.547
And...

00:44:57.815 --> 00:44:58.380
kill it!

00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.091
Somebody peed my pants.

00:45:04.666 --> 00:45:05.453
Thank God.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.550
But, I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

00:45:12.169 --> 00:45:13.920
Or just me me.

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:15.661
Time travel!

00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:20.349
What?

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:24.431
I see this as an absolute win.

00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.394
Why the long face?

00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:13.126
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

00:46:14.564 --> 00:46:16.601
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.218
It's the EPR Paradox.</b>

00:46:18.725 --> 00:46:20.953
Instead of pushing Lang through time,
you might've wound up,

00:46:20.955 --> 00:46:23.440
pushing time through Lang.
It's tricky dangerous.

00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:25.073
Somebody could have cautioned you
against it.

00:46:25.513 --> 00:46:26.313
You did.

00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:27.568
Did I?

00:46:28.078 --> 00:46:29.746
Well, thank God, I'm here.

00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:32.165
Regardless, I fixed it.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.543
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

00:46:37.464 --> 00:46:38.715
I just want peace.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.091
Turns out resentment is corrosive,
and I hate it.

00:46:44.094 --> 00:46:44.993
Me, too.

00:46:46.677 --> 00:46:48.330
We got a shot
at getting these stones but...

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.183
I got to tell you my priorities.

00:46:50.185 --> 00:46:52.521
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:55.203
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.123
And maybe not die trying.

00:46:59.693 --> 00:47:00.628
Would be nice.

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:04.119
Sounds like a deal.

00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:28.888
Tony, I don't know.

00:47:28.914 --> 00:47:29.656
Why?

00:47:30.575 --> 00:47:31.621
He made it for you.

00:47:32.582 --> 00:47:34.548
Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.302
before Morgan takes it sledding.

00:47:41.943 --> 00:47:43.069
Thank you, Tony.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.543
Will you keep that a little quiet?

00:47:46.323 --> 00:47:47.500
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

00:47:49.326 --> 00:47:50.183
We are getting...

00:47:50.508 --> 00:47:52.438
the whole team, yeah?

00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:54.338
We're working on that right now.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.682
Hey, Humie.

00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:15.755
Where's Big Green?

00:48:16.478 --> 00:48:18.202
The kitchen, I think.

00:48:19.773 --> 00:48:20.716
That's awesome.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.180
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

00:48:24.444 --> 00:48:26.050
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

00:48:27.322 --> 00:48:28.199
Oh God.

00:48:29.032 --> 00:48:30.494
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

00:49:21.918 --> 00:49:24.326
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:26.080
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

00:49:26.192 --> 00:49:27.806
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

00:49:27.808 --> 00:49:29.852
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

00:49:29.854 --> 00:49:31.628
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.097
You should not have come.

00:49:35.374 --> 00:49:36.375
Valkyrie!

00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:37.882
Great to see you,

00:49:38.048 --> 00:49:39.259
angry girl!

00:49:39.725 --> 00:49:41.943
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

00:49:42.967 --> 00:49:44.628
This is Rocket.
How ya doing?

00:49:47.235 --> 00:49:48.323
He won't see you.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:49.612
It's that bad?

00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.214
We only see him once a month
when he comes in for...

00:49:53.661 --> 00:49:54.813
supplies.

00:49:55.407 --> 00:49:56.299
It's that bad.

00:49:56.403 --> 00:49:57.031
Yeah.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.102
What the...

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.315
Something died in here!

00:50:17.456 --> 00:50:18.167
Hello?

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:19.593
Thor!

00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:21.938
Are you here about the cable?

00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:24.731
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

00:50:25.328 --> 00:50:28.070
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy
and whatnot.

00:50:28.802 --> 00:50:29.447
Thor?

00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:38.916
Boys!
Yes.

00:50:39.326 --> 00:50:40.558
Oh my God!

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.833
Oh my God, it's so good to see you!

00:50:45.115 --> 00:50:46.494
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.343
Yeah. No I'm good. I'm good.

00:50:49.715 --> 00:50:50.800
That's not necessary.

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.608
Hulk you know, ou know my friends?

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.613
Miek and Korg, right?

00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:54.741
Hey, boys!
Hey, guys.

00:50:55.053 --> 00:50:56.304
Long time no see.

00:50:56.306 --> 00:50:57.102
Beer's in the bucket.

00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:58.990
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.617
No password, obviously.

00:51:01.684 --> 00:51:03.055
Thor, he's back.

00:51:03.353 --> 00:51:05.806
That kid on the TV just called me
a dickhead again.

00:51:06.483 --> 00:51:07.678
Noobmaster.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.725
Yeah, NoobMaster69,

00:51:09.727 --> 00:51:11.569
called me a dickhead.
I am sick of this.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.155
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

00:51:14.161 --> 00:51:15.422
You know, the God of Thunder.

00:51:15.573 --> 00:51:17.690
Listen buddy, if you don't log off
this game immediately...

00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:19.350
I am gonna fly over to your house,

00:51:19.352 --> 00:51:21.285
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.536
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

00:51:24.207 --> 00:51:25.291
That's right, yes!

00:51:25.312 --> 00:51:27.189
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

00:51:27.961 --> 00:51:28.683
Thank you, Thor.

00:51:28.795 --> 00:51:30.459
Let me know if he bothers you again,
ok?

00:51:30.509 --> 00:51:31.727
Thank you very much. I will.

00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:34.145
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

00:51:34.146 --> 00:51:36.565
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:40.396
Buddy.

00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:42.133
You alright?

00:51:42.135 --> 00:51:43.644
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.028
Why, don't I look alright?

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.688
You look like melted ice cream.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:49.425
So, what's up?

00:51:49.427 --> 00:51:50.778
You just here for a hang or what?

00:51:50.942 --> 00:51:52.063
We need your help.

00:51:53.087 --> 00:51:55.446
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

00:51:55.613 --> 00:51:56.861
What, like the cable?

00:51:57.031 --> 00:51:59.325
Because that's been driving me
bananas for weeks.

00:51:59.414 --> 00:52:00.415
Like Thanos.

00:52:19.679 --> 00:52:22.515
Don't say that name.

00:52:23.071 --> 00:52:26.352
Yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.067
Please take your hand off me.

00:52:36.078 --> 00:52:37.189
Now, I know that...

00:52:38.615 --> 00:52:39.604
guy...

00:52:40.321 --> 00:52:41.576
might scare you.

00:52:41.743 --> 00:52:43.202
Why would I be...

00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:45.825
Why would I be scared of that guy?

00:52:46.623 --> 00:52:48.458
I'm the one who killed that guy,
remember?

00:52:49.627 --> 00:52:51.504
Anyone else here kill that guy?

00:52:55.018 --> 00:52:55.839
Nope.

00:52:56.716 --> 00:52:57.861
Didn't think so.

00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:00.637
Korg why don't you, tell everybody,

00:53:00.904 --> 00:53:03.009
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

00:53:03.303 --> 00:53:04.530
Stormbreaker?

00:53:04.807 --> 00:53:06.434
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:11.377
I get it.

00:53:11.379 --> 00:53:12.555
You're in a rough spot, ok?

00:53:12.594 --> 00:53:13.807
I've been there myself.

00:53:13.965 --> 00:53:16.027
You wanna know
who helped me out of it?

00:53:16.058 --> 00:53:17.324
I don't know. Is it...

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.691
Natasha?

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.311
It was you.

00:53:21.443 --> 00:53:22.560
You helped me.

00:53:24.456 --> 00:53:25.710
So, why don't you ask...

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.258
the Asgardians down there...

00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.292
how much my help is worth?

00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:38.318
The ones that are left, anyway.

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:40.394
I think we could bring them back.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.896
Stop.

00:53:43.596 --> 00:53:44.527
Stop, ok?

00:53:45.469 --> 00:53:47.987
I know you think I'm down here
wallowing in my own self...

00:53:48.057 --> 00:53:49.185
pity waiting to be...

00:53:49.257 --> 00:53:50.381
rescued and...

00:53:50.383 --> 00:53:53.554
and saved. But I'm fine, ok.
We're fine, aren't we?

00:53:53.623 --> 00:53:54.592
We're good here, mate.

00:53:54.594 --> 00:53:57.116
So, whatever it is that you're offering,
we're not into it.

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.634
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

00:53:58.973 --> 00:53:59.773
Good bye.

00:54:03.131 --> 00:54:04.188
We need you, pal.

00:54:14.407 --> 00:54:15.916
There's beer on the ship.

00:54:20.471 --> 00:54:21.394
What kind?

00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:11.494
What I want you can't give me.

00:56:35.393 --> 00:56:36.561
You should not be here.

00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:40.546
Neither should you.

00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:48.489
I've got a job to do.

00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:51.516
Is that what you're calling this?

00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:54.985
Killing all these people isn't gonna
bring your family back.

00:57:01.152 --> 00:57:02.237
We found something.

00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:05.704
A chance, maybe.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.203
Don't.

00:57:11.429 --> 00:57:12.482
Don't what?

00:57:15.769 --> 00:57:17.094
Don't give me hope.

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.738
I'm sorry, I couldn't give it
to you sooner.

00:57:44.739 --> 00:57:45.702
You're drifting left.

00:57:46.695 --> 00:57:48.203
One side there, Lebowski.</b>

00:57:51.643 --> 00:57:52.701
Ratchet, how's it going?

00:57:53.263 --> 00:57:54.869
It's Rocket. Take it easy.

00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:56.927
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

00:58:01.646 --> 00:58:03.230
Time travel suit, not bad.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.192
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!

00:58:06.194 --> 00:58:07.355
I'm being very careful.

00:58:07.443 --> 00:58:08.861
No, you're being very Hulky.

00:58:08.945 --> 00:58:09.946
I'm being careful.

00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:11.478
These are Pym Particles, alright?

00:58:11.587 --> 00:58:14.251
And ever since Hank Pym got
snapped out of existence, this is it.

00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:15.349
This is what we have.

00:58:15.351 --> 00:58:16.370
We're not making any more.

00:58:16.379 --> 00:58:18.298
Scott, calm down.
Sorry.

00:58:18.496 --> 00:58:20.689
We've got enough
for one round-trip each.

00:58:20.752 --> 00:58:21.458
That's it.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.503
No do-overs.

00:58:22.674 --> 00:58:24.554
Plus two test runs.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.181
One test run.

00:58:31.384 --> 00:58:32.094
Alright.

00:58:32.096 --> 00:58:33.195
I'm not ready for this.

00:58:33.197 --> 00:58:34.232
I'm game.

00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:37.608
I'll do it.

00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:40.375
Clint, now you're gonna feel

00:58:40.377 --> 00:58:42.056
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

00:58:42.088 --> 00:58:42.915
Don't worry about that.

00:58:42.917 --> 00:58:44.200
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.886
If we can do this, you know...

00:58:45.934 --> 00:58:48.265
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

00:58:48.267 --> 00:58:49.226
You know and...

00:58:53.682 --> 00:58:54.962
First of all that's horrible.

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:55.768
It's Thanos.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.063
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

00:58:58.202 --> 00:59:00.552
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

00:59:00.554 --> 00:59:03.281
Look we go back, we get the stones
before Thanos gets them.

00:59:03.416 --> 00:59:04.947
Thanos doesn't have the stones.

00:59:04.949 --> 00:59:06.169
Problem solved.

00:59:06.171 --> 00:59:08.006
Bingo.
That's not how it works.

00:59:08.254 --> 00:59:09.107
Well, that's what I heard.

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:10.544
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.468
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.027
Time After Time.
Quantum Leap.

00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:15.532
Wrinkle in Time.
Somewhere in Time.

00:59:15.534 --> 00:59:16.405
Hot Tub Time Machine.

00:59:16.407 --> 00:59:17.374
Hot Tub Time Machine.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.022
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.610
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

00:59:21.621 --> 00:59:23.410
DieHard. No, that's not one.

00:59:23.412 --> 00:59:24.395
This is known.

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.897
I don't know why everyone believes
that but that isn't true.

00:59:26.981 --> 00:59:28.932
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

00:59:29.228 --> 00:59:31.116
that past becomes your future...

00:59:31.652 --> 00:59:34.459
and your former present
becomes the past...

00:59:34.858 --> 00:59:37.486
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

00:59:37.512 --> 00:59:38.440
Exactly.

00:59:39.368 --> 00:59:41.437
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

00:59:46.353 --> 00:59:47.448
Alright, Clint.

00:59:48.252 --> 00:59:49.482
We're going in three.

00:59:50.215 --> 00:59:50.947
Two.

00:59:51.682 --> 00:59:52.279
One.

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:05.824
Cooper?

01:01:06.337 --> 01:01:08.721
Where are my headphones?
Lila.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.652
I never had them.
Lila?

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:13.963
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:15.840
Lila! Lila!

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.346
Yeah, Dad?

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:26.940
Dad?

01:01:29.668 --> 01:01:30.541
Lila!

01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:37.910
Hey. Hey.

01:01:38.171 --> 01:01:39.322
Hey, look at me.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:40.344
You ok?

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.039
Yeah.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:43.353
Yeah.

01:01:45.129 --> 01:01:45.767
It worked.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:48.936
It worked.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.174
Ok, so the how works.

01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:56.777
Now, we got to figure out the when,

01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.157
and the where.

01:01:59.245 --> 01:02:01.041
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter,

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.746
with at least
one of the six Infinity Stones.

01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:04.496
Or substitute the word encounter,

01:02:04.498 --> 01:02:05.601
for damn near been killed

01:02:05.603 --> 01:02:07.082
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:08.318
Well, I haven't...

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.629
but I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:12.045
Regardless,

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:15.731
we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round-trip each.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.357
And these stones have been

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.403
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

01:02:19.405 --> 01:02:20.355
Our history.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.727
So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in, yeah?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.794
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:27.182
Correct.

01:02:27.383 --> 01:02:28.003
So,

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.317
let's start with the Aether.

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:31.916
Thor, what do you know?

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.533
Is he asleep?

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:39.501
No, no.

01:02:40.003 --> 01:02:41.426
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

01:02:44.783 --> 01:02:45.540
Where to start?

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:48.757
The Aether,

01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.486
firstly is not a stone.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.686
Someone called it a stone before.

01:02:54.306 --> 01:02:55.038
It's more...

01:02:55.374 --> 01:02:57.740
of an angry sludge sort of a thing so...

01:02:58.147 --> 01:03:00.942
someone's gonna need
to amend that and stop saying that.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.863
Here's an interesting story though...

01:03:03.394 --> 01:03:04.279
about the Aether.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.323
My grandfather, many years ago,

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:08.060
had to hide the stone from...

01:03:08.462 --> 01:03:09.829
the Dark Elves.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.754
Scary beings. So Jane...

01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.867
actually...

01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:16.480
there she is.

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:18.816
Yeah, so Jane was an...

01:03:18.947 --> 01:03:20.548
old flame of mine.

01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:24.760
You know she, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

01:03:25.036 --> 01:03:27.839
and, and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

01:03:28.234 --> 01:03:30.028
and she became very, very sick.

01:03:30.065 --> 01:03:32.127
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

01:03:32.202 --> 01:03:33.370
which is where I'm from,

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.246
and we had to try and fix her.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.164
We were dating at the time,
you see I got...

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:38.847
I got to introduce her to my...

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.040
my mother...

01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:43.799
who's dead and...

01:03:45.839 --> 01:03:49.357
you know, Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:51.359
Yes, these things happen, though.
You know?

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.983
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

01:03:52.985 --> 01:03:54.258
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.390
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:03:59.536
Awesome.

01:03:59.905 --> 01:04:01.055
Eggs? Breakfast?

01:04:01.057 --> 01:04:02.930
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

01:04:03.016 --> 01:04:05.560
Quill said he stole the Power Stone
from Morag.

01:04:06.163 --> 01:04:07.390
Is that a person?

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:09.274
No, Morag's a planet.

01:04:09.982 --> 01:04:11.358
Quill was a person.

01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:14.476
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:15.865
Look.

01:04:16.145 --> 01:04:18.503
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:20.515
Do you wanna go to space?

01:04:20.533 --> 01:04:22.153
You wanna go to space, puppy?

01:04:22.303 --> 01:04:23.636
I'll take you to space.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.780
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:28.200
What is Vormir?

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:30.242
A dominion of death...

01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:33.022
at the very center
of celestial existence.

01:04:34.747 --> 01:04:35.978
It's where...

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.273
Thanos murdered my sister.

01:04:45.174 --> 01:04:46.040
Not it.

01:04:47.852 --> 01:04:49.748
That Time Stone guy.
Doctor Strange.

01:04:49.762 --> 01:04:51.628
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.590
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.179
Nice place in the Village, though.

01:04:55.213 --> 01:04:56.588
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

01:04:57.321 --> 01:04:59.236
Bleecker Street.
Wait, he lived in New York?

01:04:59.967 --> 01:05:01.373
Yeah, on Bleecker...
No, he lived in Toronto.

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:02.992
And Sullivan.
Have you been listening to anything?

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:03.745
Guys.

01:05:04.136 --> 01:05:05.757
If you pick the right year,

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.629
there are three stones in New York.

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:11.533
Shut the front door.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.359
Alright. We have a plan.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:17.986
Six stones.

01:05:18.502 --> 01:05:19.520
Three teams.

01:05:20.382 --> 01:05:21.349
One shot.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.726
Five years ago, we lost.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.559
All of us.

01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:38.942
We lost friends.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:41.270
We lost family.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:44.900
We lost a part of ourselves.

01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:48.626
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:52.769
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.869
Get the stones. Get them back.

01:05:56.633 --> 01:05:57.800
One round-trip each.

01:05:58.077 --> 01:05:59.162
No mistakes...

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:00.850
no do-overs.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.294
Most of us are going somewhere
we know.

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:05.713
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:07.673
Be careful.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.591
Look out for each other.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:12.572
This is the fight of our lives...

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.964
and we're gonna win.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.475
Whatever it takes.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:22.562
Good luck.

01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:24.442
He's pretty good at that.

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:25.774
Right?
Alright.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.215
You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

01:06:29.157 --> 01:06:30.700
Trackers engaged.

01:06:31.572 --> 01:06:33.746
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:34.707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:36.404
Ok, I'll do my best.

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.912
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.125
See ya in a minute.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.910
Alright, we all have our assignments.

01:07:39.105 --> 01:07:40.796
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.031
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:00.577
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.705
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:32.920
I'd be careful going that way.

01:08:32.922 --> 01:08:34.548
We just had the floors waxed.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.927
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.177
You're about...

01:08:44.452 --> 01:08:45.958
five years too early.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.959
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:50.463
about 20 blocks that way.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:53.468
What do you want from him?

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:55.419
That, actually.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.469
I'm afraid not.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.312
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.254
You don't want to do this.

01:09:03.256 --> 01:09:05.319
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone,

01:09:05.321 --> 01:09:06.700
and I don't have time to debate it.

01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:17.072
Let's start over, shall we?

01:09:28.624 --> 01:09:29.821
For you, Lady Jane.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.794
So you have anything with pants?

01:09:32.937 --> 01:09:34.063
Pants?

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.256
Never mind. These will be fine.
Thank you.

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.050
Yes, milady.
There is Jane.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:40.468
Alright.

01:09:42.262 --> 01:09:43.513
Here's the deal, tubby.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.723
You're gonna charm her,

01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:46.174
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing,

01:09:46.176 --> 01:09:48.655
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:51.357
I'll be right back, ok?

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:51.839
This is...

01:09:52.052 --> 01:09:53.563
The wine cellar is just down here.

01:09:53.565 --> 01:09:56.286
My father used to have
this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

01:09:56.435 --> 01:09:58.095
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

01:09:58.097 --> 01:09:58.880
Hey. Hey!

01:09:59.045 --> 01:10:00.842
Aren't you drunk enough already?

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:08.722
If you could send Loki some soup.

01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:09.390
Yes, milady.

01:10:09.392 --> 01:10:10.538
And ask our librarians

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.994
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.935
Who's the fancy broad?

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:23.488
That's my mother.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.536
She dies today.

01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:28.600
That is today?

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:36.380
I can't do this.

01:10:36.717 --> 01:10:37.810
I can't do this.

01:10:37.995 --> 01:10:39.982
I should not be here.
I should not have come.

01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.042
It's a bad idea!

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:42.599
Come here.
No, no, no.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.866
I think I'm having, a panic attack.

01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:46.115
Come here.
I should not be here.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:46.965
Right here.
This is bad.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:49.951
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

01:10:49.961 --> 01:10:51.341
What do you think we're doing here?

01:10:51.774 --> 01:10:53.863
I lost the only family I ever had.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:56.702
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

01:10:56.775 --> 01:10:57.781
all gone.

01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:00.173
I get you miss your mom...

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:01.675
but she's gone.

01:11:01.842 --> 01:11:02.843
Really gone.

01:11:03.427 --> 01:11:05.995
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.556
and you can help them.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.183
So, is it too much to ask

01:11:10.185 --> 01:11:12.142
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.284
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...</b>

01:11:14.399 --> 01:11:15.952
and when she's not looking,

01:11:16.102 --> 01:11:17.784
suck out the Infinity Stone...

01:11:17.786 --> 01:11:19.547
and help me get my family back?

01:11:21.052 --> 01:11:21.875
Ok.

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:23.405
Are you crying?

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.044
No.

01:11:27.159 --> 01:11:28.065
Yes.

01:11:28.414 --> 01:11:29.750
I feel like I'm losing it.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:30.871
Get it together!

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:31.946
You can do this.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:34.541
You can do this.

01:11:37.577 --> 01:11:38.399
Alright?

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:39.880
Yes, I can.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:40.939
Good.

01:11:43.085 --> 01:11:44.103
I can do this.

01:11:44.192 --> 01:11:45.441
I can do this.

01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:47.529
I can't do this.

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.814
Alright, heartbreaker, she's alone.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.003
This is our shot.

01:11:51.602 --> 01:11:52.345
Thor?

01:11:53.237 --> 01:11:54.050
Thor!

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.077
Alright, bring it down, Blue.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.286
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

01:12:13.489 --> 01:12:14.790
Hey, can we hurry it up?

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:16.878
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:18.961
All that is really helpful.

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.672
Take care, ok?
Yeah.

01:12:23.003 --> 01:12:25.119
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.511
Hey.
We got this.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.025
Let's get it done.
Yes, sir.

01:12:29.054 --> 01:12:30.028
I'll see you back.

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:32.448
You guys watch each other's six.

01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:34.309
Yeah.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:44.528
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:48.073
All they have to do is not fall out.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.093
We're a long way from Budapest.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:02.413
Ok, so...

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:07.356
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:09.217
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.369
Let's take cover.

01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:15.725
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:17.655
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

01:13:17.657 --> 01:13:18.976
Who else is looking for these stones?

01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:23.264
My father...

01:13:23.859 --> 01:13:25.072
my sister...

01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:26.717
and me.

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:28.280
And you?

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.253
Where are you right now?

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:01.605
You're welcome.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.902
I didn't ask for your help.

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:06.359
And yet, you always need it.

01:14:10.405 --> 01:14:12.735
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

01:14:12.737 --> 01:14:13.622
Why?

01:14:13.742 --> 01:14:15.744
He's found an Infinity Stone.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:21.371
Where?

01:14:21.742 --> 01:14:23.494
On a planet called Morag.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.172
Father's plan is finally in motion.

01:14:27.339 --> 01:14:29.341
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:30.607
It's a start.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.577
If he gets all of them...

01:14:45.562 --> 01:14:47.442
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

01:14:47.444 --> 01:14:49.154
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:50.541
He won't like that.

01:14:50.779 --> 01:14:52.635
His alternative is death.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.847
Ronan's obsession...

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:58.808
clouds his judgment.

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:05.585
We will not fail you, Father.

01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:07.975
No, you won't.

01:15:10.966 --> 01:15:11.967
I swear...

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.563
I will make you proud.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:24.870
<i>We just,</i>

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.240
<i>wait around for this,</i>

01:15:26.242 --> 01:15:29.364
<i>Quill guy to show up and then he
leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?</i>

01:15:30.285 --> 01:15:31.441
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

01:15:32.885 --> 01:15:35.763
<i>We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.</i>

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.052
Who was that?

01:15:39.661 --> 01:15:40.479
I don't know.

01:15:40.668 --> 01:15:42.749
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.213
Her synaptic drive was probably
damaged in battle.

01:15:57.757 --> 01:15:59.395
Bring her to my ship.

01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:08.354
Better hustle, Cap.

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:10.183
Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.203
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.006
If it's all the same to you...

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.168
I'll have that drink now.

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.099
Alright, get him on his feet.

01:16:26.588 --> 01:16:28.750
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:30.940
By the way, feel free to clean up.

01:16:31.616 --> 01:16:33.965
Mr. Rogers,
I almost forgot that that suit,

01:16:34.132 --> 01:16:35.755
did nothing for your ass.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.447
<i>No one asked you to look, Tony.</i>

01:16:37.457 --> 01:16:39.128
It's ridiculous.
<i>I think you look great, Cap.</i>

01:16:39.622 --> 01:16:42.364
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.268
Who gets the, magic wand?

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:45.972
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

01:16:56.451 --> 01:16:58.014
We can take that off your hands.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:16:59.532
By all means.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:03.557
Careful with that thing.
Yeah.

01:17:03.705 --> 01:17:05.088
Unless you want your mind erased.

01:17:05.212 --> 01:17:06.289
And not in a fun way.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.501
We promise to be careful.

01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:08.637
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

01:17:08.639 --> 01:17:10.008
They are S.H.I.E.I.D.

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:13.338
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.347
<i>Seriously? You didn't?
I mean...</i>

01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:17.262
<i>they look like bad guys.</i>

01:17:17.264 --> 01:17:19.016
You're small, but you're talking loud.

01:17:19.077 --> 01:17:20.951
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

01:17:20.953 --> 01:17:22.953
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:25.683
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:26.999
Shut up.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:29.410
Alright, you're up, little buddy.

01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:30.821
There's our stone.

01:17:31.379 --> 01:17:32.205
Alright.

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:33.649
Flick me.

01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:48.912
Move.
Hey.

01:17:49.616 --> 01:17:50.804
Hey, hey. Buddy!

01:17:50.841 --> 01:17:53.119
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

01:17:53.441 --> 01:17:54.445
Take the stairs.
Yes.

01:17:55.026 --> 01:17:55.820
Stop, stop.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.104
Take the stairs.

01:18:00.262 --> 01:18:01.561
Hate the stairs.

01:18:05.296 --> 01:18:07.851
Alright Cap,
I got our scepter in the elevator,

01:18:07.853 --> 01:18:09.741
just passing the 80th floor.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.413
On it.

01:18:12.318 --> 01:18:13.106
Head to the lobby.

01:18:13.197 --> 01:18:14.293
<i>Alright, I'll see you there.</i>

01:18:14.678 --> 01:18:15.789
Evidence secure.

01:18:16.283 --> 01:18:17.671
We're en route to Doctor List.

01:18:18.283 --> 01:18:18.893
No.

01:18:19.726 --> 01:18:21.259
No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:27.537
Captain.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.394
I thought you were coordinating
search and rescue.

01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:31.044
Change of plans.

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:36.263
Hey, Cap.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.742
Rumlow.

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.182
I just got a call from the secretary.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.225
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:52.393
Sir?

01:18:52.855 --> 01:18:54.147
I don't understand.

01:18:56.336 --> 01:18:58.314
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:18:59.244
Sorry, Cap.

01:19:00.089 --> 01:19:01.449
We can't give you the scepter.

01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:03.685
I'm gonna have to call the director.

01:19:04.091 --> 01:19:04.984
That's ok.

01:19:05.483 --> 01:19:06.196
Trust me.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:10.811
Hail Hydra.

01:19:25.408 --> 01:19:26.998
So many stairs!

01:19:38.973 --> 01:19:41.837
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

01:19:41.845 --> 01:19:42.930
It is go time.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.145
<i>Bombs away.</i>

01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:53.873
<i>Is. Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.334
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:57.577
Can we focus, please?

01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:58.920
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:00.630
<i>Now.</i>

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.968
May I ask you where you're going?

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.482
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:11.641
Alexander Pierce.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.017
He's the man above the folks

01:20:13.019 --> 01:20:13.911
behind Nick Fury.

01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.525
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

01:20:15.527 --> 01:20:18.079
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn that prisoner over to me.

01:20:18.295 --> 01:20:20.145
Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:21.342
No, he's going to answer to us.

01:20:21.344 --> 01:20:22.494
Odin can have what's left.

01:20:22.603 --> 01:20:23.966
And I'm gonna need that case.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.271
That's been S.H.I.E.I.D. property
for over 70 years.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.355
Hand over the case, Stark.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:28.906
Alright, move it, Stuart Little.

01:20:28.908 --> 01:20:30.191
Things are getting dicey out here.
Let's go.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.071
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

01:20:32.073 --> 01:20:33.626
<i>You promise me you won't die?</i>

01:20:33.674 --> 01:20:36.402
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

01:20:36.708 --> 01:20:38.153
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:39.347
I need the case.

01:20:39.349 --> 01:20:40.969
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

01:20:40.971 --> 01:20:42.182
jurisdict...
ok, then give me the case.

01:20:42.184 --> 01:20:42.951
Well, jurisdiction...

01:20:43.183 --> 01:20:44.672
Hand it over. Hand it over.
Hand it over.

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.675
Do it, Lang!

01:20:45.677 --> 01:20:46.678
Get your hands off me.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.140
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:50.013
Here goes!

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:54.007
Stark?
Stark?

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:56.990
He's convulsing. Give him air!

01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:58.752
Medic!
Medic!

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.606
Give these guys some help.

01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:01.904
Speak to me.

01:21:02.442 --> 01:21:04.235
Stark, is it your chest machine?

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:08.323
Breathe, breathe.

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.844
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.710
No stairs!

01:21:31.006 --> 01:21:32.847
Come on Stark, stay with us.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.960
I'm going to try something. Ok?
I have no idea if it's going to work.

01:21:37.231 --> 01:21:38.079
Yes!

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:39.316
That worked a treat.

01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:40.570
Dude, that was so crazy.

01:21:40.572 --> 01:21:41.985
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

01:21:42.474 --> 01:21:43.912
The case.
The case is...

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:46.444
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

01:21:47.272 --> 01:21:48.181
Loki!

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:49.855
<i>That wasn't supposed to happen,
was it?</i>

01:21:49.857 --> 01:21:50.857
We blew it.

01:21:51.382 --> 01:21:52.289
Loki?

01:21:54.786 --> 01:21:56.079
Tony, what's going on?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.569
Tell me you found that Cube.

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:03.044
You got to be shitting me.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:09.342
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.693
I'm not Loki...

01:22:14.354 --> 01:22:15.981
and I don't wanna hurt you.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.163
I can do this all day.

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:27.133
Yeah, I know.

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:28.653
I know.

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:02.395
Where did you get this?

01:23:13.581 --> 01:23:16.625
Bucky is alive.

01:23:20.188 --> 01:23:20.935
What?

01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:37.606
That is America's ass.

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:43.269
Please, please.

01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:45.148
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.607
If I give up the Time Stone

01:23:47.609 --> 01:23:49.392
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:51.176
With all due respect, alright...

01:23:51.181 --> 01:23:54.267
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

01:24:00.203 --> 01:24:01.448
The Infinity Stones,

01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:04.092
create what you experience
as the flow of time.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.209
Remove one of the stones...

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.849
and that flow splits.

01:24:08.628 --> 01:24:10.659
Now, this may benefit your reality...

01:24:11.255 --> 01:24:13.382
but my new one, not so much.

01:24:13.758 --> 01:24:15.468
In this new branch reality,

01:24:15.832 --> 01:24:18.787
without our chief weapon
against the forces of darkness,

01:24:19.292 --> 01:24:21.057
our world would be overrun.

01:24:21.224 --> 01:24:22.830
Millions will suffer.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.352
So tell me Doctor.

01:24:24.873 --> 01:24:27.175
Can your science prevent all that?

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:28.272
No.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:30.399
But we can erase it.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.393
Because once we're done
with the stones,

01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:34.612
we can return each one
to its own timeline,

01:24:34.614 --> 01:24:36.115
at the moment it was taken.

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.218
So, chronologically...

01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:41.151
in that reality...

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:44.612
it never left.

01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:50.151
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:56.759
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

01:24:56.926 --> 01:24:59.583
We will. I will. I promise.

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:02.530
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

01:25:03.972 --> 01:25:04.987
It's the duty...

01:25:05.205 --> 01:25:06.726
of the Sorcerer Supreme

01:25:06.728 --> 01:25:08.522
to protect the Time Stone.

01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:11.102
Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?

01:25:12.853 --> 01:25:13.938
What did you say?

01:25:13.971 --> 01:25:16.617
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

01:25:17.113 --> 01:25:18.698
Willingly?
Yes.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.343
Why?
I have no idea.

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:25.792
Maybe he made a mistake.

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:37.550
Or I did.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.239
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

01:26:00.644 --> 01:26:03.039
So, he must've done it for a reason.

01:26:03.834 --> 01:26:05.461
I fear you might be right.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.566
Thank you.

01:26:17.757 --> 01:26:19.425
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

01:26:21.578 --> 01:26:22.787
We all are.

01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:44.580
Run diagnostics.

01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:47.064
Show me her memory file.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:51.457
Sire, the file appears entangled.

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:54.585
It was a memory, but not hers.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:26:58.468
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.591
Another Nebula.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:03.848
Impossible.

01:27:04.425 --> 01:27:06.726
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.885
from nine years in the future.

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:16.812
Where is this other Nebula?

01:27:17.817 --> 01:27:20.121
In our solar system on Morag.

01:27:21.362 --> 01:27:22.655
Can you access her?

01:27:22.822 --> 01:27:24.570
Yes, the two are linked.

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:26.932
Search the duplicate's memories,

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.197
for Infinity Stones.

01:27:32.976 --> 01:27:34.281
<i>And these stones have been</i>

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:36.509
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:37.319
<i>Our history.</i>

01:27:37.654 --> 01:27:40.096
<i>So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in.</i>

01:27:40.508 --> 01:27:42.378
<i>Which means we have
to pick our targets.</i>

01:27:42.803 --> 01:27:44.011
<i>Correct.</i>
Freeze image.

01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:47.023
Terrans.

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:49.704
Avengers.

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:52.562
Unruly wretches.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:54.437
What's that reflection?

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:57.231
Amplify this, Maw.

01:28:00.672 --> 01:28:01.793
I don't understand.

01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:07.855
Two Nebulas.

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:09.040
No.

01:28:09.422 --> 01:28:10.829
The same Nebula...

01:28:11.697 --> 01:28:13.238
from two different times.

01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:16.058
Set course for Morag.

01:28:16.459 --> 01:28:18.320
And scan the duplicate's memories.

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:21.646
I wanna see everything.

01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:33.261
My ladies, I'll see you after.

01:28:33.893 --> 01:28:35.311
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

01:28:49.644 --> 01:28:50.352
What are you doing?

01:28:52.036 --> 01:28:52.711
God!

01:28:53.386 --> 01:28:56.165
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

01:28:56.167 --> 01:28:58.341
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

01:28:58.639 --> 01:28:59.833
What are you wearing?

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:02.014
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.676
What's wrong with your eye?

01:29:07.986 --> 01:29:08.668
My eye it's...

01:29:08.670 --> 01:29:09.883
Remember the...

01:29:09.971 --> 01:29:12.588
Battle of Harokin
when I got hit in the face with the...

01:29:12.871 --> 01:29:14.018
broadsword?

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:19.772
You're not the Thor I know at all,
are you?

01:29:20.523 --> 01:29:21.354
Yes, I am.

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.277
The future hasn't been kind to you,
has it?

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:27.513
I didn't say I was from the future.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.234
I was raised by witches, boy.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.078
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:38.415
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.209
Yes, you are, honey.

01:29:40.266 --> 01:29:41.767
I really need to talk to you.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:43.176
We can talk.

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:08.986
His head was over there...

01:30:09.945 --> 01:30:11.508
and his body over there...

01:30:13.526 --> 01:30:15.601
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.372
I was just standing there.

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:21.083
Some idiot with an axe.

01:30:21.172 --> 01:30:22.882
Now, you're no idiot.

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:25.269
You're here, aren't you?

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.340
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

01:30:28.674 --> 01:30:29.717
I am. Yes.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:31.217
Idiot, no.

01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:32.779
A failure?

01:30:33.162 --> 01:30:34.288
Absolutely.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:35.824
That's a little bit harsh.

01:30:35.826 --> 01:30:37.327
Do you know what that makes you?

01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:40.373
Just like everyone else.

01:30:41.045 --> 01:30:43.232
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:47.486
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.994
The measure of a person, of a hero...

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:54.506
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:01.623
I've really missed you, Mom.

01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:09.381
Thor! I got it!

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:11.569
Get that rabbit!

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.467
Mom, I have to tell you something.

01:31:16.469 --> 01:31:18.155
No, son, you don't.

01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:21.130
You're here to repair your future,
not mine.

01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:24.185
This is about your future.
It's none of my business.

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:28.900
Hi.

01:31:29.636 --> 01:31:31.267
You must be Mom.

01:31:31.902 --> 01:31:33.650
I got the thing. Come on.
We got to move.

01:31:33.753 --> 01:31:35.000
I wish we had more time.

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:37.034
No, this was a gift.

01:31:37.378 --> 01:31:39.831
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.181
I love you, Mom.

01:31:42.183 --> 01:31:43.249
I love you.

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:49.366
And eat a salad.

01:31:50.631 --> 01:31:51.757
Come on, we got to go.

01:31:51.924 --> 01:31:53.109
Goodbye.
Three.

01:31:53.676 --> 01:31:54.760
Two.
No, wait!

01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:59.223
What am I looking at?

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:00.849
Sometimes it takes a second.

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.594
I'm still worthy.

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.900
Boy.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.105
Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye.

01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:58.947
So, he's an idiot?

01:33:00.631 --> 01:33:01.435
Yeah.

01:33:10.627 --> 01:33:11.684
What's that?

01:33:12.004 --> 01:33:13.249
The tool of a thief.

01:33:23.428 --> 01:33:25.423
This is the part where spikes
come out,

01:33:25.434 --> 01:33:27.009
with skeletons on the end of them
and everything.

01:33:27.019 --> 01:33:28.228
What are you talking about?

01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:29.464
When you break into a place called

01:33:29.466 --> 01:33:30.890
The Temple of the Power Stone,

01:33:30.892 --> 01:33:32.407
there is gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

01:33:32.409 --> 01:33:34.045
Ok. Alright. Go ahead.
Oh my God.

01:34:07.893 --> 01:34:09.394
I wasn't always like this.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.313
Me either.

01:34:13.107 --> 01:34:14.673
But we work with what we got, right?

01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:19.473
Let's sync up.

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:23.795
Three, two, one.

01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:38.677
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

01:34:38.966 --> 01:34:40.466
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.331
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:44.763
<i>Gone.</i>

01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:46.849
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

01:34:47.224 --> 01:34:48.892
<i>You used them two days ago!</i>

01:34:49.207 --> 01:34:52.120
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.095
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

01:34:54.309 --> 01:34:55.876
<i>But the work is done.</i>

01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.277
<i>It always will be.</i>

01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:02.511
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

01:35:04.283 --> 01:35:05.726
What did you do to them?

01:35:06.493 --> 01:35:07.307
Nothing.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.526
Yet.

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:13.440
They're not trying to stop something

01:35:13.442 --> 01:35:14.940
I'm going to do in our time.

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.754
They're trying to undo something

01:35:17.756 --> 01:35:19.299
I've already done in theirs.

01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:20.516
The stones.

01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:23.336
I found them all.

01:35:25.846 --> 01:35:26.742
I won.

01:35:27.973 --> 01:35:30.673
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.332
This is your future.

01:35:37.024 --> 01:35:38.573
It's my destiny.

01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:41.778
<i>My father is many things.</i>

01:35:42.377 --> 01:35:43.965
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

01:35:48.035 --> 01:35:49.566
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

01:35:50.041 --> 01:35:52.210
<i>Perhaps I treated you too harshly.</i>

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:59.090
And that is destiny fulfilled.

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:00.937
Sire...

01:36:01.538 --> 01:36:02.664
your daughter...

01:36:05.219 --> 01:36:06.064
No!

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:07.862
Is a traitor.

01:36:07.888 --> 01:36:10.349
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

01:36:10.421 --> 01:36:11.802
I would never betray you.

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:13.024
Never. Never.

01:36:19.441 --> 01:36:20.609
I know.

01:36:21.568 --> 01:36:24.052
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:31.932
No!

01:36:32.913 --> 01:36:33.903
He knows!

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.663
Barton! Barton, come in.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.287
Romanoff!

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:44.552
Come in, we have a problem.

01:36:44.883 --> 01:36:45.705
Come on!

01:36:46.082 --> 01:36:47.121
Come in, we have a...

01:36:47.683 --> 01:36:48.728
Thanos knows.

01:36:49.763 --> 01:36:50.495
Thanos...

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:05.565
Cap!

01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:09.130
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

01:37:10.481 --> 01:37:11.512
Yeah, we do.

01:37:12.294 --> 01:37:13.375
Well, what are we gonna do now?

01:37:13.377 --> 01:37:14.535
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:15.987
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

01:37:16.505 --> 01:37:17.791
You said that we had one shot.

01:37:17.958 --> 01:37:19.379
This was our shot.

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:21.528
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:23.275
It was six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself, you know that?

01:37:23.467 --> 01:37:24.337
You're repeating yourself.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:25.789
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:26.695
Dude.
You don't know!

01:37:26.697 --> 01:37:28.250
Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.334
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:30.627
I dropped the ball.
You ruined the time heist.

01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:31.770
Is that what I did?
Yeah.

01:37:31.772 --> 01:37:33.589
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:35.453
No, no, no, there is no other options.

01:37:35.455 --> 01:37:36.614
There's no do-overs.

01:37:36.616 --> 01:37:39.051
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

01:37:39.054 --> 01:37:39.737
Each.

01:37:40.105 --> 01:37:42.306
That's it. Alright?
We use that...

01:37:42.566 --> 01:37:43.774
bye-bye, you're not going home.

01:37:43.839 --> 01:37:45.193
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

01:37:46.028 --> 01:37:47.584
then no one else is going home, either.

01:37:47.734 --> 01:37:48.735
I got it.

01:37:49.573 --> 01:37:51.522
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

01:37:51.524 --> 01:37:53.537
and acquire new particles.

01:37:54.453 --> 01:37:55.899
Little stroll down memory lane.

01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:58.123
Military installation, Garden State.

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:03.441
When were they both there?

01:38:03.443 --> 01:38:05.985
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

01:38:06.528 --> 01:38:07.980
How vague?
What are you talking about?

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:08.760
Where are we going?

01:38:08.762 --> 01:38:10.016
I know for a fact they were there.

01:38:10.018 --> 01:38:10.466
Who's they?

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:11.864
What are we doing?
And I know how I know.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:15.255
Guys what is, what is it?

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:17.643
Looks like we're improvising.

01:38:18.018 --> 01:38:19.375
Great.
What are we improvising?

01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:21.367
Scott, get this back to the compound.

01:38:21.499 --> 01:38:22.299
Suit up.

01:38:22.481 --> 01:38:23.488
What's in New Jersey?

01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:24.740
0.4 0.4

01:38:24.996 --> 01:38:26.193
0.7 0.7

01:38:26.253 --> 01:38:27.826
Excuse me?
1.9.7.0

01:38:28.612 --> 01:38:29.613
Are you sure?

01:38:29.696 --> 01:38:31.240
Cap? Captain?

01:38:31.242 --> 01:38:33.077
Steve? Sorry.

01:38:33.158 --> 01:38:34.461
America. Rogers.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.029
Look, if you do this...

01:38:36.453 --> 01:38:38.771
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:41.612
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:43.930
You trust me?

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:45.877
I do.

01:38:47.214 --> 01:38:48.264
Your call.

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:50.664
Here we go.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:10.522
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.680
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

01:39:19.682 --> 01:39:20.979
The idea of me was.

01:39:22.049 --> 01:39:23.636
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.I.D...

01:39:23.702 --> 01:39:27.069
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

01:39:28.547 --> 01:39:29.639
where do you hide it?

01:39:30.165 --> 01:39:31.408
In plain sight.

01:40:00.291 --> 01:40:01.693
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

01:40:01.737 --> 01:40:03.995
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:08.712
You new here?

01:40:11.256 --> 01:40:12.388
Not exactly.

01:40:19.306 --> 01:40:21.099
Come on, you bastard.

01:40:27.898 --> 01:40:28.948
Gotcha.

01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:48.140
Back in the game.

01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:52.464
Arnim, you in there?

01:40:53.423 --> 01:40:54.466
Arnim?

01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:00.617
Hey!

01:41:01.601 --> 01:41:02.860
The door is this way, pal.

01:41:04.787 --> 01:41:05.352
Yeah.

01:41:05.751 --> 01:41:07.395
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:10.790
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

01:41:12.484 --> 01:41:13.377
Pardon me.

01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:15.592
Do I know you?

01:41:17.447 --> 01:41:18.448
No, sir.

01:41:19.908 --> 01:41:21.335
I'm a visitor from M.I.T.

01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:23.197
M.I.T.

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:24.874
Got a name?

01:41:25.549 --> 01:41:26.189
Howard.

01:41:26.592 --> 01:41:28.007
That'll be easy to remember.

01:41:28.313 --> 01:41:29.205
Howard?

01:41:30.572 --> 01:41:31.322
Potts.

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:33.375
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

01:41:34.214 --> 01:41:34.880
Hi.

01:41:35.067 --> 01:41:36.312
Shake that, don't pull it.

01:41:36.375 --> 01:41:37.376
Yeah.

01:41:39.177 --> 01:41:41.525
You look a little green around the gills,
there, Potts.

01:41:41.555 --> 01:41:43.532
I'm fine. Just long hours.

01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:45.154
You wanna get some air?

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:49.525
Hello, Potts.
Yeah.

01:41:50.011 --> 01:41:51.272
That'd be swell.
That way.

01:41:51.328 --> 01:41:51.861
Ok.

01:41:52.587 --> 01:41:53.828
Need your briefcase?

01:41:58.655 --> 01:42:00.636
You're not one of those beatniks,
are you, Potts?

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.873
Hello?
<i>Doctor Pym?</i>

01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:11.359
That would be the number
that you called, yes.

01:42:11.418 --> 01:42:13.842
<i>This is Captain Stevens from shipping.</i>

01:42:13.951 --> 01:42:15.150
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

01:42:15.358 --> 01:42:16.216
Bring it up.

01:42:16.603 --> 01:42:18.024
<i>That's the thing sir, we can't.</i>

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:22.131
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

01:42:22.554 --> 01:42:23.383
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

01:42:24.097 --> 01:42:25.557
<i>Sir the box is glowing and...</i>

01:42:25.712 --> 01:42:28.220
<i>to be honest some of our
mail guys aren't feeling that great.</i>

01:42:28.735 --> 01:42:30.258
They didn't open it, did they?

01:42:30.332 --> 01:42:32.181
<i>Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

01:42:33.565 --> 01:42:35.024
Excuse me! Out of the way!

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:05.758
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

01:43:06.623 --> 01:43:08.098
My wife's expecting.

01:43:08.558 --> 01:43:10.936
And too much time at the office.

01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:14.443
Congratulations.

01:43:14.773 --> 01:43:16.900
Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
Yeah, sure.

01:43:17.984 --> 01:43:18.871
How far along is she?

01:43:19.058 --> 01:43:19.820
I don't know.

01:43:21.863 --> 01:43:24.464
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

01:43:25.027 --> 01:43:27.653
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry, again.

01:43:29.162 --> 01:43:30.163
I have a little girl.

01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:31.587
A girl would be nice.

01:43:31.998 --> 01:43:33.850
Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

01:43:34.668 --> 01:43:36.028
What'd be so awful about that?

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:38.266
Let's just say that
the greater good has...

01:43:38.427 --> 01:43:39.810
rarely outweighed...

01:43:40.382 --> 01:43:41.718
my own self-interest.

01:43:45.579 --> 01:43:46.820
And you've never seen
these two men before?

01:43:46.822 --> 01:43:48.908
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

01:43:48.932 --> 01:43:49.760
Can you describe them?

01:43:49.805 --> 01:43:51.397
One of them had a hippie beard.

01:43:51.405 --> 01:43:53.295
Hippie. Like Bee Gees
or Mungo Jerry?

01:43:53.297 --> 01:43:54.381
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

01:43:54.383 --> 01:43:55.395
Yeah, this is Chesler.

01:43:55.397 --> 01:43:57.335
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

01:43:57.817 --> 01:43:59.694
We have a potential breach.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:18.443
I said bring them in.

01:44:18.453 --> 01:44:19.435
They're trying, ma'am,

01:44:19.437 --> 01:44:20.802
but Braddock's unit has been
stopped by lightning strikes.

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:22.191
For the love of...

01:44:22.699 --> 01:44:25.255
I'll look at the weather projections.

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:49.100
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

01:45:00.467 --> 01:45:02.200
And so, where you at with names?

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.287
Well, if it's a boy,

01:45:03.289 --> 01:45:05.130
my wife likes Elmonzo.

01:45:06.575 --> 01:45:08.180
Might wanna let that stew awhile.
You got time.

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:11.679
Let me ask you a question.

01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:14.050
When your kid was born,

01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:16.309
were you nervous?

01:45:16.311 --> 01:45:16.973
Wildly.

01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.606
Yeah.
Did you feel qualified?

01:45:19.773 --> 01:45:20.801
Like you had any...

01:45:21.269 --> 01:45:23.429
idea how to successfully
operate that thing?

01:45:23.777 --> 01:45:26.694
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.782
I thought about what my dad did.

01:45:29.643 --> 01:45:32.265
My old man, he never met a
problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

01:45:32.615 --> 01:45:34.390
I thought my dad was tough on me.

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:35.997
And now, looking back on it,

01:45:35.999 --> 01:45:37.152
I just remember the good stuff.

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.996
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:40.581
Yeah? Like what?

01:45:41.795 --> 01:45:44.030
No amount of money
ever bought a second of time.

01:45:45.632 --> 01:45:46.674
Smart guy.

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:48.316
He did his best.

01:45:49.928 --> 01:45:51.522
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

01:45:51.765 --> 01:45:53.589
and there is nothing
I would not do for him.

01:46:02.216 --> 01:46:03.344
Good to meet you, Potts.

01:46:04.776 --> 01:46:05.509
Yeah.

01:46:05.944 --> 01:46:06.636
Howard...

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:09.024
everything's gonna be alright.

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:13.145
Thank you...

01:46:14.494 --> 01:46:15.653
for everything...

01:46:16.246 --> 01:46:17.842
you've done for this country.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:22.414
Jarvis.

01:46:26.005 --> 01:46:27.285
Have we ever met that guy?

01:46:29.801 --> 01:46:31.302
You meet a lot of people, sir.

01:46:33.930 --> 01:46:35.165
Seems very familiar.

01:46:36.474 --> 01:46:37.520
Weird beard.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.310
You're weak.

01:46:47.819 --> 01:46:48.903
I'm you.

01:47:06.349 --> 01:47:07.949
You could stop this.

01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:10.608
You know you want to.

01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:13.281
Did you see what happens
in the future?

01:47:14.888 --> 01:47:17.265
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

01:47:18.808 --> 01:47:20.608
You wanna know how he does that?

01:47:22.186 --> 01:47:23.110
You wanna know...

01:47:24.138 --> 01:47:25.104
what he does...

01:47:25.513 --> 01:47:26.359
to you?

01:47:26.858 --> 01:47:27.794
That's enough.

01:47:40.538 --> 01:47:41.903
You disgust me.

01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:44.117
But...

01:47:44.478 --> 01:47:45.908
that doesn't mean...

01:47:46.449 --> 01:47:47.728
you're useless.

01:48:10.257 --> 01:48:11.252
How do I look?

01:48:20.286 --> 01:48:21.991
Under different circumstances...

01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:25.091
this would be totally awesome.

01:48:37.662 --> 01:48:39.681
I bet the raccoon
didn't have to climb a mountain.

01:48:40.723 --> 01:48:42.642
Technically he's not a raccoon,
you know?

01:48:42.725 --> 01:48:44.095
Whatever. He eats garbage.

01:48:44.815 --> 01:48:45.635
Welcome.

01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:50.078
Natasha.

01:48:50.642 --> 01:48:51.718
Daughter of Ivan.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:53.674
Clint.

01:48:54.153 --> 01:48:55.662
Son of Edith.

01:49:01.828 --> 01:49:02.877
Who are you?

01:49:04.064 --> 01:49:06.049
Consider me a guide...

01:49:06.599 --> 01:49:07.562
to you...

01:49:08.024 --> 01:49:10.403
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.322
Good.

01:49:11.587 --> 01:49:13.632
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:19.470
If only it were that easy.

01:49:32.236 --> 01:49:35.139
What you seek lies in front of you.

01:49:36.946 --> 01:49:38.882
As does what you fear.

01:49:44.376 --> 01:49:45.704
The stone's down there.

01:49:46.789 --> 01:49:47.902
For one of you.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.282
For the other...

01:49:53.379 --> 01:49:55.298
In order to take the stone...

01:49:55.465 --> 01:49:57.909
you must lose that which you love.

01:49:59.844 --> 01:50:02.220
An everlasting exchange.

01:50:04.015 --> 01:50:05.215
A soul...

01:50:06.115 --> 01:50:07.156
for a soul.

01:50:10.688 --> 01:50:11.625
How's it going?

01:50:15.485 --> 01:50:16.587
Jesus.

01:50:17.236 --> 01:50:19.022
Maybe he's making this shit up.

01:50:19.665 --> 01:50:20.563
No.

01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:22.992
I don't think so.

01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:25.419
Why? Because he knows
your daddy's name?

01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:28.414
I didn't.

01:50:29.916 --> 01:50:31.799
Thanos left here with the stone...

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:34.367
without his daughter.

01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:36.389
That's not a coincidence.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.695
Yeah.

01:50:41.177 --> 01:50:42.490
Whatever it takes.

01:50:47.558 --> 01:50:48.784
Whatever it takes.

01:50:53.439 --> 01:50:54.811
If we don't get that stone...

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:56.982
billions of people stay dead.

01:50:58.111 --> 01:50:58.716
Yeah.

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:03.056
Then I guess we both know
who it's got to be.

01:51:04.033 --> 01:51:05.201
I guess we do.

01:51:13.626 --> 01:51:14.643
I'm starting to think,

01:51:15.358 --> 01:51:16.612
we mean different people here,

01:51:17.023 --> 01:51:18.115
Natasha.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.832
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

01:51:20.842 --> 01:51:21.913
Get to right here.

01:51:22.127 --> 01:51:24.345
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

01:51:24.347 --> 01:51:26.590
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

01:51:26.594 --> 01:51:28.130
What, you think I wanna do it?

01:51:29.392 --> 01:51:31.308
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:33.152
Yeah well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

01:51:34.564 --> 01:51:36.412
Natasha, you know what I've done.

01:51:38.442 --> 01:51:39.957
You know what I've become.

01:51:42.323 --> 01:51:44.706
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.286
Maybe you should.

01:51:51.247 --> 01:51:52.380
You didn't.

01:51:58.963 --> 01:52:00.659
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

01:52:12.112 --> 01:52:12.728
Ok.

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:16.262
You win.

01:52:23.196 --> 01:52:24.493
Tell my family I love them.

01:52:27.997 --> 01:52:28.932
You tell them yourself.

01:53:02.291 --> 01:53:03.292
Damn you.

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:11.421
Wait.

01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:21.006
Let me go.

01:53:22.797 --> 01:53:23.583
No.

01:53:25.549 --> 01:53:26.550
Please, no.

01:53:29.929 --> 01:53:30.986
It's ok.

01:53:33.808 --> 01:53:34.809
Please.

01:53:36.894 --> 01:53:37.895
No!

01:55:19.372 --> 01:55:20.373
Did we get them all?

01:55:21.791 --> 01:55:23.584
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

01:55:28.422 --> 01:55:29.484
Clint, where's Nat?

01:55:58.869 --> 01:56:00.130
Do we know if she had family?

01:56:01.038 --> 01:56:01.847
Yeah.

01:56:02.373 --> 01:56:03.374
Us.

01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:05.835
What?

01:56:07.795 --> 01:56:09.120
What are you doing?
Just asked him a question.

01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:10.538
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

01:56:10.548 --> 01:56:11.747
Why are we acting like she's dead?

01:56:11.757 --> 01:56:13.008
We have the stones, right?

01:56:13.175 --> 01:56:14.333
As long as we have the stones.

01:56:14.343 --> 01:56:16.148
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

01:56:16.150 --> 01:56:18.348
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:19.397
Can't get her back.

01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:23.980
What's he... What?

01:56:23.982 --> 01:56:25.192
It can't be undone.

01:56:25.855 --> 01:56:26.762
It can't.

01:56:29.661 --> 01:56:31.053
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

01:56:31.055 --> 01:56:32.873
but you're a very earthly being.

01:56:33.068 --> 01:56:34.711
Ok, and we're talking
about space magic.

01:56:34.851 --> 01:56:36.890
And can't seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

01:56:36.892 --> 01:56:38.588
Yeah, look, I know that
I'm way outside my...

01:56:38.713 --> 01:56:39.671
my pay grade here.

01:56:39.861 --> 01:56:41.374
But she still isn't here, is she?

01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.621
No, that's my point.

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:43.521
It can't...

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:45.145
be undone.

01:56:45.776 --> 01:56:49.171
Or that's at least what the red,
floating guy had to say.

01:56:49.271 --> 01:56:50.880
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, ok?

01:56:51.046 --> 01:56:52.212
Go grab your hammer,

01:56:52.214 --> 01:56:54.092
and you go fly and you talk to him.

01:57:02.383 --> 01:57:03.512
It was supposed to be me.

01:57:06.937 --> 01:57:09.288
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:10.659
She bet her life on it.

01:57:15.732 --> 01:57:16.872
She's not coming back.

01:57:19.909 --> 01:57:21.368
We have to make it worth it.

01:57:21.842 --> 01:57:22.781
We have to.

01:57:24.767 --> 01:57:25.673
We will.

01:57:51.190 --> 01:57:51.741
Boom!

01:57:57.863 --> 01:57:59.323
Alright, the glove's ready.

01:58:00.241 --> 01:58:02.516
Question is, who's gonna snap
their freaking fingers?

01:58:02.993 --> 01:58:05.079
I'll do it.
Excuse me?

01:58:05.204 --> 01:58:05.860
It's ok.

01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:07.331
Hey. Stop, stop.
Slow down.

01:58:07.531 --> 01:58:08.512
Thor. Just wait.

01:58:08.649 --> 01:58:10.338
You know we haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:14.245
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

01:58:14.334 --> 01:58:15.500
We should at least discuss it.

01:58:15.633 --> 01:58:17.612
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

01:58:17.614 --> 01:58:19.185
is not gonna bring everybody back.

01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:21.888
I'm the strongest Avenger, ok?

01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:23.683
So this responsibility falls upon me.

01:58:23.685 --> 01:58:24.895
It's my duty.
Normally, you're right.

01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:26.827
It's not about that.
It's not that.

01:58:27.062 --> 01:58:28.402
Stop it! Just let me.

01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:32.931
Just let me do it.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.638
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.601
Look, it's not just the fact
that that glove

01:58:37.603 --> 01:58:39.531
is channeling enough energy
to light up a continent.

01:58:39.572 --> 01:58:41.633
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.785
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.989
Cheez. Whiz.

01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:49.540
Lightning.

01:58:49.573 --> 01:58:50.699
Yeah.
Lightning.

01:58:50.851 --> 01:58:52.227
Lightning won't help you, pal.

01:58:52.543 --> 01:58:53.953
It's got to be me.

01:58:55.713 --> 01:58:57.749
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

01:58:58.048 --> 01:58:59.359
They almost killed him.

01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:02.886
None of you could survive.

01:59:03.596 --> 01:59:04.904
How do we know you will?

01:59:05.389 --> 01:59:06.432
We don't.

01:59:06.724 --> 01:59:08.788
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:13.863
It's like...

01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:17.744
I was made for this.

01:59:37.087 --> 01:59:38.301
Good to go, yeah?

01:59:40.716 --> 01:59:41.717
Let's do it.

01:59:41.884 --> 01:59:43.150
Ok, remember,

01:59:43.171 --> 01:59:45.128
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago.

01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:46.993
You're just bringing them
back to now, today.

01:59:47.723 --> 01:59:49.449
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

01:59:50.559 --> 01:59:51.440
Got it.

02:00:08.368 --> 02:00:09.370
Friday, do me a favor

02:00:09.372 --> 02:00:11.080
and activate Barn Door Protocol,
will ya?

02:00:11.082 --> 02:00:11.942
Yes, boss.

02:00:20.964 --> 02:00:22.352
Everybody comes home.

02:00:46.198 --> 02:00:47.730
Take it off! Take it off!

02:00:47.732 --> 02:00:49.037
No, wait. Bruce, are you ok?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Talk to me, Banner.

02:00:54.456 --> 02:00:55.457
I'm ok.

02:00:55.958 --> 02:00:56.985
I'm ok.

02:01:28.699 --> 02:01:29.825
Bruce!

02:01:31.577 --> 02:01:32.387
Don't move him.

02:01:40.043 --> 02:01:42.408
Did it work?
We're not sure. It's ok.

02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.426
Honey.

02:02:29.593 --> 02:02:30.552
Clint?

02:02:30.719 --> 02:02:31.702
Honey.

02:02:32.672 --> 02:02:33.797
Guys...

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.976
I think it worked.

02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:22.479
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:25.524
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

02:03:32.155 --> 02:03:33.949
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

02:03:35.117 --> 02:03:36.660
Let me up! Let me up!

02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:38.211
Come on!

02:03:48.297 --> 02:03:49.131
Rhodey!

02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:59.391
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:01.001
<i>We 're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

02:04:01.003 --> 02:04:02.382
What? What?

02:04:02.573 --> 02:04:04.742
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

02:04:05.105 --> 02:04:07.024
Wait! I'm here!

02:04:07.441 --> 02:04:08.942
I'm here. Can you hear me?

02:04:28.587 --> 02:04:29.796
Cap?

02:04:53.779 --> 02:04:54.905
Ok.

02:05:14.174 --> 02:05:15.300
Daughter.

02:05:15.467 --> 02:05:16.635
Yes, Father.

02:05:18.512 --> 02:05:20.222
So, this is the future.

02:05:20.889 --> 02:05:21.829
Well done.

02:05:22.641 --> 02:05:23.845
Thank you, Father.

02:05:24.434 --> 02:05:25.811
They suspected nothing.

02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:29.481
The arrogant never do.

02:05:32.442 --> 02:05:33.568
Go.

02:05:34.528 --> 02:05:36.947
Find the stones, bring them to me.

02:05:37.114 --> 02:05:38.247
What will you do?

02:05:40.158 --> 02:05:41.181
Wait.

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:08.361
Tell me something.

02:06:09.855 --> 02:06:11.039
In the future...

02:06:12.814 --> 02:06:14.086
what happens to you and me?

02:06:16.611 --> 02:06:17.887
I try to kill you.

02:06:19.948 --> 02:06:21.238
Several times.

02:06:22.534 --> 02:06:23.853
But eventually...

02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:25.920
we become friends.

02:06:28.123 --> 02:06:29.513
We become sisters.

02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:38.717
Come on.

02:06:40.761 --> 02:06:41.938
We can stop him.

02:06:50.645 --> 02:06:51.743
Come on, buddy, wake up!

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:53.607
That's my man.

02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:56.073
You lose this again,

02:06:56.387 --> 02:06:57.366
I'm keeping it.

02:07:00.489 --> 02:07:01.509
What happened?

02:07:01.823 --> 02:07:03.728
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

02:07:03.944 --> 02:07:04.820
You'll see.

02:07:27.099 --> 02:07:28.304
What's he been doing?

02:07:30.393 --> 02:07:31.629
Absolutely nothing.

02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:34.708
Where are the stones?

02:07:35.816 --> 02:07:37.116
Somewhere under all this.

02:07:39.027 --> 02:07:40.538
All I know is he doesn't have them.

02:07:41.404 --> 02:07:42.855
So, we keep it that way.

02:07:43.135 --> 02:07:44.422
You know it's a trap, right?

02:07:44.866 --> 02:07:45.756
Yeah.

02:07:46.368 --> 02:07:47.405
I don't much care.

02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:49.278
Good.

02:07:50.413 --> 02:07:52.619
Just as long as
we're all in agreement.

02:08:02.676 --> 02:08:04.495
Let's kill him properly this time.

02:08:14.062 --> 02:08:16.526
You could not live
with your own failure.

02:08:18.483 --> 02:08:20.122
Where did that bring you?

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.583
Back to me.

02:08:28.756 --> 02:08:30.976
I thought by eliminating half of life...

02:08:32.164 --> 02:08:33.667
the other half would thrive.

02:08:34.793 --> 02:08:36.127
But you've shown me...

02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:38.785
that's impossible.

02:08:40.881 --> 02:08:43.824
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

02:08:44.342 --> 02:08:47.256
there will always be those
that are unable,

02:08:47.385 --> 02:08:49.283
to accept what can be.

02:08:50.307 --> 02:08:51.558
They will resist.

02:08:52.058 --> 02:08:53.764
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

02:08:54.895 --> 02:08:56.052
I'm thankful.

02:08:58.648 --> 02:08:59.860
Because now...

02:09:00.567 --> 02:09:02.247
I know what I must do.

02:09:03.153 --> 02:09:04.265
I will,

02:09:04.664 --> 02:09:08.218
shred this universe
down to its last atom.

02:09:09.117 --> 02:09:10.366
And then...

02:09:11.006 --> 02:09:13.342
with the stones
you've collected for me,

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.443
create a new one,

02:09:16.537 --> 02:09:18.066
teeming with life,

02:09:18.752 --> 02:09:20.629
that knows not what it has lost,

02:09:20.717 --> 02:09:22.792
but only what it has been given.

02:09:26.259 --> 02:09:27.760
A grateful universe.

02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:29.498
Born out of blood.

02:09:29.804 --> 02:09:31.161
They'll never know it.

02:09:32.572 --> 02:09:35.099
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.548
See you on the other side, man.

02:09:53.828 --> 02:09:55.830
Hang on! I'm coming!

02:10:26.111 --> 02:10:27.112
Yeah!

02:10:42.002 --> 02:10:42.743
Hey.

02:10:43.712 --> 02:10:44.663
I know you.

02:10:48.294 --> 02:10:49.295
Father.

02:10:50.093 --> 02:10:51.319
I have the stones.

02:10:51.678 --> 02:10:52.406
What?

02:10:53.972 --> 02:10:54.889
Stop.

02:11:00.103 --> 02:11:01.521
You're betraying us?

02:11:07.527 --> 02:11:08.820
You don't have to do this.

02:11:11.656 --> 02:11:12.438
I am...

02:11:13.544 --> 02:11:14.222
This.

02:11:14.326 --> 02:11:16.244
No, you're not.

02:11:16.703 --> 02:11:18.432
You've seen what we become.

02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:26.520
Nebula, listen to her.

02:11:28.542 --> 02:11:29.575
You can change.

02:11:35.889 --> 02:11:37.250
He won't let me.

02:11:39.017 --> 02:11:39.817
No!

02:11:59.412 --> 02:12:00.789
Ok, Thor. Hit me.

02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:18.560
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

02:13:10.024 --> 02:13:11.317
I knew it!

02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:36.237
In all my years of conquest...

02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:38.876
violence...

02:14:40.615 --> 02:14:41.985
slaughter...

02:14:43.701 --> 02:14:45.235
it was never personal.

02:14:49.051 --> 02:14:50.169
But I'll tell you now...

02:14:52.794 --> 02:14:55.547
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

02:14:56.524 --> 02:14:58.355
annoying little planet...

02:15:00.802 --> 02:15:02.344
I'm gonna enjoy it...

02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:05.348
very, very much.

02:16:09.787 --> 02:16:11.331
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

02:16:17.337 --> 02:16:19.077
<i>Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?</i>

02:16:23.682 --> 02:16:24.865
<i>On your left.</i>

02:17:50.659 --> 02:17:51.839
Is that everyone?

02:17:52.181 --> 02:17:53.775
What? You wanted more?

02:18:21.155 --> 02:18:22.145
Avengers!

02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.708
Assemble.

02:19:04.295 --> 02:19:05.546
Die!

02:19:26.192 --> 02:19:27.091
No, no, give me that.

02:19:27.502 --> 02:19:28.600
You have the little one.

02:19:42.625 --> 02:19:43.459
Hey!

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.461
Holy cow!

02:19:45.628 --> 02:19:47.078
You will not believe
what's been going on.

02:19:47.088 --> 02:19:48.581
Do you remember
when we were in space?

02:19:48.695 --> 02:19:49.885
And I got all dusty?

02:19:50.007 --> 02:19:51.094
And I must've passed out,

02:19:51.096 --> 02:19:52.472
because I woke up
and you were gone.

02:19:52.577 --> 02:19:54.627
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

02:19:54.637 --> 02:19:56.137
It's been five years.
Come on, they need us.

02:19:56.305 --> 02:19:57.964
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing,

02:19:57.974 --> 02:19:59.079
that he does all the time.
He did? No.

02:19:59.081 --> 02:19:59.843
What are you doing?

02:20:05.333 --> 02:20:06.352
This is nice.

02:20:28.956 --> 02:20:29.864
Gamora?

02:20:39.181 --> 02:20:40.587
I thought I lost you.

02:20:45.438 --> 02:20:47.892
Don't... touch... me!

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:52.752
You missed the first time.

02:20:53.362 --> 02:20:55.364
Then you got them both
the second time.

02:20:57.366 --> 02:20:58.451
This is the one?

02:20:58.618 --> 02:20:59.619
Seriously?

02:20:59.870 --> 02:21:02.022
Your choices were him or a tree.

02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:13.168
Cap!

02:21:13.758 --> 02:21:15.626
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.264
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

02:21:20.431 --> 02:21:21.474
No!

02:21:22.642 --> 02:21:24.602
We need to get them back
where they came from.

02:21:24.769 --> 02:21:25.695
No way to get them back.

02:21:25.697 --> 02:21:27.031
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

02:21:27.521 --> 02:21:28.356
Hold on!

02:21:30.232 --> 02:21:32.016
That wasn't our only time machine.

02:21:38.366 --> 02:21:40.190
Anyone see
an ugly brown van out there?

02:21:40.826 --> 02:21:43.620
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:46.254
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

02:21:47.416 --> 02:21:48.584
Maybe 10 minutes.

02:21:48.751 --> 02:21:50.305
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

02:21:50.482 --> 02:21:51.446
We're on it, Cap.

02:22:01.722 --> 02:22:02.454
Hey.

02:22:03.015 --> 02:22:05.171
You said one out of 14 million,
we win, yeah?

02:22:06.936 --> 02:22:07.937
Tell me this is it.

02:22:08.354 --> 02:22:10.052
If I tell you what happens...

02:22:10.593 --> 02:22:11.680
it won't happen.

02:22:15.425 --> 02:22:16.426
You better be right.

02:22:24.578 --> 02:22:25.955
It's a mess back here.

02:22:27.256 --> 02:22:28.557
It's dead.

02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:30.333
What?
It's dead.

02:22:30.918 --> 02:22:32.230
I have to hot-wire it.

02:22:35.423 --> 02:22:36.461
Where's Nebula?

02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:38.975
She's not responding.

02:22:39.468 --> 02:22:40.466
Sire.

02:22:50.563 --> 02:22:51.264
Clint!

02:22:53.858 --> 02:22:54.802
Give it to me.

02:23:17.256 --> 02:23:20.424
You took everything from me.

02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:23.011
I don't even know who you are.

02:23:23.512 --> 02:23:24.442
You will.

02:23:47.578 --> 02:23:48.537
I got it!

02:23:51.082 --> 02:23:52.166
Activate Instant Kill.

02:24:15.606 --> 02:24:16.941
Rain fire!

02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:19.568
But, sire, our troops!

02:24:19.735 --> 02:24:21.214
Just do it!

02:24:42.438 --> 02:24:43.743
Is anyone else seeing this?

02:24:57.940 --> 02:24:59.066
I got this!

02:24:59.316 --> 02:25:01.110
I got this. Ok, I don't got this.

02:25:01.443 --> 02:25:02.611
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

02:25:02.778 --> 02:25:04.462
Hey, Queens, heads up!

02:25:14.707 --> 02:25:15.751
Hang on. I got you, kid.

02:25:19.378 --> 02:25:20.590
Hey! Nice to meet you.

02:25:21.035 --> 02:25:22.151
Oh my God!

02:25:58.792 --> 02:26:00.252
What the hell is this?

02:26:01.045 --> 02:26:02.224
Friday, what are they firing at?

02:26:02.232 --> 02:26:04.037
<i>Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.</i>

02:26:18.384 --> 02:26:19.165
Yeah!

02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:40.562
Danvers,

02:26:40.872 --> 02:26:42.084
we need an assist here.

02:26:50.678 --> 02:26:51.694
Hi, I'm...

02:26:52.264 --> 02:26:53.265
Peter Parker.

02:26:53.889 --> 02:26:55.066
Hey, Peter Parker.

02:26:55.528 --> 02:26:56.546
You got something for me?

02:27:02.773 --> 02:27:05.208
I don't know how you're gonna get it
through all of that.

02:27:06.527 --> 02:27:07.945
Don't worry.

02:27:08.821 --> 02:27:10.406
She's got help.

02:29:58.198 --> 02:29:59.136
I am...

02:29:59.888 --> 02:30:01.050
inevitable.

02:30:21.847 --> 02:30:22.892
And I...

02:30:25.058 --> 02:30:25.999
am...

02:30:29.938 --> 02:30:31.250
Iron Man.

02:32:30.142 --> 02:32:31.287
Mr. Stark?

02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:33.138
Hey!

02:32:34.529 --> 02:32:35.469
Mr. Stark.

02:32:35.789 --> 02:32:36.872
Can you hear me?

02:32:37.649 --> 02:32:38.702
It's Peter.

02:32:40.719 --> 02:32:41.361
Hey.

02:32:43.155 --> 02:32:44.087
We won,

02:32:44.581 --> 02:32:45.695
Mr. Stark.

02:32:48.035 --> 02:32:49.431
We won, Mr. Stark.

02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:53.572
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

02:32:55.125 --> 02:32:56.877
I'm sorry.

02:32:57.044 --> 02:32:58.045
Tony.

02:33:11.725 --> 02:33:12.577
Hey.

02:33:12.934 --> 02:33:13.919
Hey, Pep.

02:33:19.066 --> 02:33:19.999
Friday?

02:33:20.317 --> 02:33:21.992
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

02:33:31.662 --> 02:33:32.663
Tony?

02:33:33.914 --> 02:33:34.935
Look at me.

02:33:37.668 --> 02:33:38.862
We're gonna be ok.

02:33:44.299 --> 02:33:45.731
You can rest now.

02:35:31.698 --> 02:35:34.034
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i></font>

02:35:34.659 --> 02:35:36.284
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But it doesn't always roll that way.</i></font>

02:35:38.955 --> 02:35:40.133
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Maybe this time.</i></font>

02:35:42.209 --> 02:35:44.527
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm hoping if you play this back,</i></font>

02:35:46.546 --> 02:35:47.881
<font color="#00ffff"><i>it's in celebration.</i></font>

02:35:49.132 --> 02:35:52.967
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i></font>

02:35:52.969 --> 02:35:55.776
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And something like a normal version

02:35:59.601 --> 02:36:00.822

02:36:01.277 --> 02:36:02.605
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Universe, now.</i></font>

02:36:03.563 --> 02:36:05.690
<font color="#00ffff"><i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone,</i></font>

02:36:05.692 --> 02:36:07.625

02:36:07.771 --> 02:36:10.765
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I would not have been
surprised but come on, who knew?</i></font>

02:36:11.363 --> 02:36:14.239

02:36:25.443 --> 02:36:27.867

02:36:37.931 --> 02:36:40.930

02:36:49.683 --> 02:36:50.830
<font color="#00ffff"><i>What am I even tripping for?</i></font>

<font color="#00ffff"><i>I love you 3,000.</i></font>

02:39:15.213 --> 02:39:16.797
You know, I wish there was a way...

02:39:17.647 --> 02:39:18.857
that I could let her know.

02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:22.585
That we won.

02:39:24.973 --> 02:39:25.773
We did it.

02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:31.304
She knows.

02:39:36.943 --> 02:39:38.200
They both do.

02:39:47.996 --> 02:39:49.180
How you doing, squirt?

02:39:49.505 --> 02:39:50.248
Good.

02:39:50.337 --> 02:39:51.096
You good?

02:39:51.988 --> 02:39:53.321
Ok. You hungry?

02:39:55.045 --> 02:39:56.046
What do you want?

02:39:56.755 --> 02:39:57.835
Cheeseburgers.

02:40:02.969 --> 02:40:04.658
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

02:40:05.388 --> 02:40:06.230
Ok.

02:40:09.392 --> 02:40:11.169
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

02:40:11.811 --> 02:40:12.487
Ok.

02:40:29.579 --> 02:40:30.398
So...

02:40:31.247 --> 02:40:32.861
when can we expect you back?

02:40:35.642 --> 02:40:36.644
About that...

02:40:37.210 --> 02:40:39.578
Thor, your people need a king.

02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:41.191
No, they already have one.

02:40:43.746 --> 02:40:44.747
That's funny.

02:40:50.016 --> 02:40:51.337
Are you being serious?

02:40:55.522 --> 02:40:57.427
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than...

02:40:58.467 --> 02:40:59.924
who I'm supposed to be.

02:41:02.237 --> 02:41:03.988
But you, you're a leader.

02:41:04.614 --> 02:41:05.732
That's who you are.

02:41:08.736 --> 02:41:10.596
You know, I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

02:41:10.954 --> 02:41:12.074
I'm counting on it...

02:41:12.622 --> 02:41:13.683
Your Majesty.

02:41:24.259 --> 02:41:25.468
What will you do?

02:41:26.133 --> 02:41:27.229
I'm not sure.

02:41:28.047 --> 02:41:29.801
For the first time
in a thousand years, I...

02:41:30.419 --> 02:41:31.514
I have no path.

02:41:31.516 --> 02:41:32.792
I do have a ride though.

02:41:33.101 --> 02:41:34.817
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

02:41:39.566 --> 02:41:40.717
Well, here we are.

02:41:41.568 --> 02:41:43.111
Tree, good to see you.

02:41:47.761 --> 02:41:50.379
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

02:41:51.411 --> 02:41:52.912
Where to first?

02:41:54.414 --> 02:41:55.456
Hey.

02:41:56.167 --> 02:41:58.127
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

02:41:58.365 --> 02:41:59.366
I'm in charge.

02:41:59.627 --> 02:42:02.104
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

02:42:02.463 --> 02:42:03.464
Of course.

02:42:06.634 --> 02:42:08.823
See, you say, of course,
but then you touch the map.

02:42:09.345 --> 02:42:10.606
It makes you think that maybe

02:42:10.616 --> 02:42:12.138
you didn't realize I was in charge.

02:42:12.473 --> 02:42:13.906
Quail, that's your own

02:42:13.907 --> 02:42:15.142
insecurities in there.
Quail?

02:42:15.143 --> 02:42:17.535
Ok? I am merely trying
to be of service and assisting.

02:42:17.562 --> 02:42:18.291
Quill.

02:42:18.938 --> 02:42:19.814
That's what I said.

02:42:19.981 --> 02:42:22.416
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

02:42:22.525 --> 02:42:23.585
Sounds fair.

02:42:26.654 --> 02:42:28.021
It's not necessary.
It's not.

02:42:28.738 --> 02:42:30.029
Ok?
I got some blasters,

02:42:30.031 --> 02:42:31.466
unless you guys wanna use knives.

02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:34.032
Yes! Please, use knives.

02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:35.205
Yeah. Knives.

02:42:35.207 --> 02:42:36.410
I am Groot.

02:42:42.747 --> 02:42:44.124
Not necessary.

02:42:44.127 --> 02:42:45.875
There shall be
no knifing one another.

02:42:45.877 --> 02:42:48.272
Everybody knows, who's in charge.

02:42:52.430 --> 02:42:53.067
Me.

02:42:54.724 --> 02:42:55.558
Right?

02:42:56.476 --> 02:42:58.396
Yes, you.

02:42:58.937 --> 02:43:01.178
Of course! Of course.

02:43:01.522 --> 02:43:02.476
Of course.

02:43:04.943 --> 02:43:05.979
Remember...

02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.611
you have to return the stones

02:43:08.613 --> 02:43:09.771
to the exact moment you got them

02:43:09.781 --> 02:43:10.722
or you're gonna open up

02:43:10.724 --> 02:43:12.462
a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

02:43:13.159 --> 02:43:14.160
Don't worry, Bruce.

02:43:14.702 --> 02:43:15.774
Clip all the branches.

02:43:17.121 --> 02:43:18.334
You know, I tried.

02:43:20.166 --> 02:43:21.968
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,

02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:23.691
I really tried to bring her back.

02:43:27.674 --> 02:43:28.934
I miss her, man.

02:43:29.832 --> 02:43:30.688
Me too.

02:43:34.764 --> 02:43:37.183
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

02:43:39.769 --> 02:43:40.996
You're a good man, Sam.

02:43:41.709 --> 02:43:43.252
This one's on me, though.

02:43:47.777 --> 02:43:49.696
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

02:43:51.531 --> 02:43:52.486
How can I?

02:43:52.949 --> 02:43:54.571
You're taking all the stupid with you.

02:44:02.333 --> 02:44:03.737
Gonna miss you, buddy.

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:05.624
It's gonna be ok, Buck.

02:44:13.386 --> 02:44:14.919
How long is this gonna take?

02:44:15.430 --> 02:44:17.968
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

02:44:23.271 --> 02:44:24.522
You ready, Cap?

02:44:24.689 --> 02:44:27.108
Alright, we'll meet you back here, ok?

02:44:27.775 --> 02:44:28.901
You bet.

02:44:30.403 --> 02:44:31.988
Going quantum. Three.

02:44:32.572 --> 02:44:33.406
Two.

02:44:34.073 --> 02:44:34.839
One.

02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:38.942
And returning in five.

02:44:39.370 --> 02:44:40.077
Four.

02:44:40.496 --> 02:44:41.237
Three.

02:44:41.652 --> 02:44:42.287
Two.

02:44:42.732 --> 02:44:43.330
One.

02:44:51.090 --> 02:44:52.091
Where is he?

02:44:52.258 --> 02:44:54.215
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

02:44:54.225 --> 02:44:55.230
He should be here.

02:45:01.243 --> 02:45:02.161
Get him back.

02:45:02.226 --> 02:45:03.693
I'm trying.
Get him the hell back.

02:45:03.695 --> 02:45:04.727
Hey, I said I'm trying.

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:05.725
Sam.

02:45:29.238 --> 02:45:30.366
Go ahead.

02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:49.740
Cap?

02:45:52.026 --> 02:45:52.974
Hi, Sam.

02:45:56.781 --> 02:45:59.623
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

02:46:01.953 --> 02:46:03.011
Well, after I...

02:46:03.422 --> 02:46:05.291
put the stones back, I thought...

02:46:06.916 --> 02:46:07.823
maybe...

02:46:08.751 --> 02:46:10.592
I'll try some of that life Tony was...

02:46:11.672 --> 02:46:12.930
telling me to get.

02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:17.238
How'd that work out for ya?

02:46:20.179 --> 02:46:21.350
It was beautiful.

02:46:22.932 --> 02:46:24.376
Good. I'm happy for you.

02:46:24.809 --> 02:46:25.687
Truly.

02:46:26.602 --> 02:46:27.589
Thank you.

02:46:29.230 --> 02:46:30.646
Only thing bumming me out

02:46:30.648 --> 02:46:32.257
is the fact I have to live in a world

02:46:32.259 --> 02:46:33.779
without Captain America.

02:46:38.030 --> 02:46:39.493
That reminds me.

02:46:49.333 --> 02:46:50.294
Try it on.

02:47:16.068 --> 02:47:17.299
How does it feel?

02:47:20.156 --> 02:47:21.729
Like it's someone else's.

02:47:24.911 --> 02:47:26.078
It isn't.

02:47:39.425 --> 02:47:40.379
Thank you.

02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:44.013
I'll do my best.

02:47:49.393 --> 02:47:51.021
That's why it's yours.

02:47:53.022 --> 02:47:54.456
You wanna tell me about her?

02:48:00.988 --> 02:48:01.986
No.

02:48:02.907 --> 02:48:04.479
No, I don't think I will.

02:49:04.078 --> 02:49:07.098
